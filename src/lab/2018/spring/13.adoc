//
Today's lab is a final project checkpoint.
//
At this point we expect you to be done with your UI and moving on to the
functionality for your app.
//
The course staff will review your progress to confirm this, and you'll have a
chance to present your idea to the rest of your lab and get feedback.

*Remember that the link:/MP/2018/spring/7/[final project] has extra credit points for labs
that produce impressive projects*.
//
So now is a good time to start working together and helping each other out.

For the first half of today's lab the course staff will circulate to check in on
you project status.
//
20 points are handed out today for having a working UI, with 10 points for
having made some progress and 0 points for not having made any.
//
Your lab course staff will also use this as an opportunity to ask about your
road map for completing the project by next week, and answer questions you might
have.

While the course staff is reviewing other groups work on your <<pitches, project
pitch>> for the second half of today's lab.

//
In the second half of this lab, each project group should _very briefly_ present
their project idea to the rest of their lab section.

Being able to provide a short summary of a project to another person is
extremely important.
//
So important that it has a name&mdash;an
//

//
footnote:[the idea being that if you were stuck in an elevator with Elon
Musk and had only 30 seconds to pitch him on your exciting idea...].
//
One characteristic of good pitches is that they are short, so try to keep yours
to under 60 seconds.
//
After you're done you'll have time to take a few questions from other students
in your lab section.

[[next]]
== Next Week

During next week's lab we'll present the final videos from each group and
complete project grading.
//
At that point your app should be fully functional.
//
Remember that the final project fair is Thursday 5/3/2018, and that there are
multiple ways to earn extra credit at the fair.

Use the remaining lab time to complete the ICES forms evaluating your TA.
//
Thanks for the feedback&mdash;we really appreciate it.
