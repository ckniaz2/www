//
The command line is an important power tool for every computer programmer and
technologist.
//
Once you master it it allows you to accomplish more than you can using graphical
interfaces, and accomplish those things faster and more accurately.
//
Essentially the command line allows you to interact with your computer
_programmatically_, writing what are essentially small programs one line at a
time.

This lab will introduce you to the command line environment.
//
To make this as safe and fun as possible, we'll encourage you to install and use
a virtualized Linux machine to learn and practice your command line skills.
//
This will both provide you with the complete power available to a system
administrator, while also ensuring that you can't do anything too terrible to
your computer.

== Lab Structure

Note that this lab is a bit different than previous labs.
//
There is no written component, and no programming component either.
//
Instead, you'll install some software, and then complete a few tasks using your
new command line skills.
//
We've also left things underspecified and open-ended.
//
This is intentional.
//
The best resources for learning the command line is the internet, and you should
feel free to search online for help, tutorials, and even solutions.

_If you are skilled at the command line_, please feel free to help those around
you.
//
This environment is new to many, and your experience will be appreciated by
those that are experiencing the terminal for the first time.

== Getting a Command Line

[.lead]
//
Our first task in this lab is to provide you with a command line environment
that you can experiment with.
//
To accomplish this, we're going to use a powerful and important computer
technology called _virtualization_.

Our goal is to provide you with an environment that is both powerful and safe.
//
If you follow our instructions, you will be left with a new virtual computer
that you both have complete control over (power) and is also completely isolated
from the rest of your computer system (safety).

The first step is to download and install the free
https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] virtualization software.

What is virtualization?
//
In a nutshell, virtualization allows you to create a _virtual machine_: a
separate computer that runs inside your existing computer.
//
The virtual machine is completely isolated from the computer it runs
on&mdash;called the host&mdash;and from any other virtual machines you create.
//
It has its own memory, file system, and networking configuration.
//
Programs running _inside_ the virtual machine cannot affect or even seen
anything outside the virtual machine.

As a result, you can experiment inside your virtual machine without endangering
anything outside.
//
For example, if you accidentally remove every file in your virtual machine
footnote:[Oops], all of the files on the host are unaffected.
//
It is also extremely easy to restore your virtual machine to its starting point,
making it an ideal environment for experimentation.

With VirtualBox installed, you can now create a virtual machine.
//
Because the virtual machine is, in fact, a completely separate computer, we can
install an entirely new operating system on it.
//
And that's what we're going to to do.

Go ahead and install Ubuntu Linux in your virtual machine.
//
We'll let you figure out how to do this by searching around online&mdash;there
are many, many tutorials on this.
//
The specific version of Ubuntu is up to you, but we suggest that you install
//
http://lubuntu.me/downloads/[Lubuntu 16.04.3]
//
which is a lightweight long-term support release.
//
*Do not install Lubuntu 17.10&mdash;this is known not to work on VirtualBox.*
//
These release will continue to be supported for long periods of time, unlike the
latest and greatest which changes about once per year.

You can download and install pre-built Ubuntu images for VirtualBox.
//
But it's a bit more fun the first time to actually install using the install CD
image from the Ubuntu website, since it gives you a visceral sense that this is
a separate computer.
//
The process is exactly the same as if you were installing on so-called
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-metal_server[_bare metal_].

=== Other Ways to Get a Command Line

Depending on your what kind of machine you use you have other options for
getting a command prompt.
//
These other options don't all provide the same combination of power and safety
of our approach.
//
But if you can accept the trade-offs, or run into trouble with the approach
above, feel free to give them a try:

. Mac OS has a built-in Linux-like command line environment, which is one of the
reasons that Apples tend to be popular with hackers.
//
Run the Terminal app and you'll be presented with a `bash` prompt.
//
*Keep in mind, however, that mistakes made at the command line can do serious and
potentially irreparable damage to your machine.*
//
. All versions of Windows have their own terminal program, but it's extremely
unpleasant to use.
//
We don't recommend taking the time to learn it.
//
However, as of Windows 10 Windows users can now install a variety of Linux
utilities including standard shells that provide a more powerful command line
environment.
//
Start learning more
//
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about[here].
//
_We definitely recommend that Windows users explore this option_.
//
*Keep in mind, however, that mistakes made at the command line can do serious and
potentially irreparable damage to your machine.*
//
. Illinois provides a variety of remote access Linux and UNIX servers that you
can access over SSH.
//
Instructions for accessing the EWS servers via SSH are available
//
https://it.engineering.illinois.edu/user-guides/remote-access/accessing-linux-terminals-remotely-ssh[here].
//
However, unlike your own virtual machine, you will not have full administrator
access to these shared machines.
//
That's a good thing&mdash;if you did, you could wreak all kinds of havoc.
//
But if you're learning and want to do things like install software, configure
servers, and other fun machine administration tasks, not having administrator
access can be limiting.

[[navigating]]
== Getting Started [.text-muted]#(20 Minutes)#

Most of this information is easily available online, but here's just a primer to
get you started.

=== Anatomy of a Command Line Command

Consider this command line command:

[source,bash]
----
$ ls -l Documents
----

Like many, it consists of several parts:

* `ls`: this is the command itself&mdash;a computer program that runs and
serves some purpose.
//
* `Documents`: this is an _argument_ to the `ls` command.
//
Arguments many be required or optional, and their meaning depends on the command
that we are running.
//
In this case, `Documents` tells `ls` to list files in the `Documents` subdirectory of
the current directory.
//
* `-l`: this is a command _option_.
//
Options are normally optional, but can sometimes be required.
//
They typically alter the commands behavior in some way.
//
In this case, the `-l` option to `ls` tells it to use a long listing format,
which displays more information about each file and directory it encounters.

=== Navigating the File System

Many of the most widely-used command line operations involve navigating your
computer's file system.
//
You may have only semi-realized this, but your computer organizes all of its
files into a tree with a single root.
//
Directories&mdash;which you may know as folders&mdash;can contain files, but
also may contain other directories.
//
Some of this organization is up to you.

Inside your new terminal, try the following commands and determine what the do:

* `pwd`
//
* `ls`
//
* `cd`
//
* `find`
//
* `mkdir`
//
* `rmdir`
//
* `rm`... but be careful with this one!
//
There is no undo or recycling bin for `rm`!

[[exercises]]
== Command Line Exercises [.text-muted]#(40 Minutes)#

With your brand new command line environment set up, let's get down to some
exercises.
//
See how many of the following tasks you can accomplish during the lab period.

=== Clone and Build the Lab12 GitHub Project

Just as in previous labs we've set up an Eclipse project for Lab 12 on
//
https://github.com/cs125-illinois/Lab12[GitHub].
//
https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork]
//
and clone a copy of our repository as you have
//
link:/lab/3/#forking[previously].
//
However, this time *do not start Eclipse*.
//
Instead, figure out how to clone and build the project from the command line.
//
(You will need to fork the project using GitHub's web interface.)
//
If you get stuck, refer to the screencast above.

=== Practice Using SVN and Git

. *Checkout and build one of your MPs.*
//
Using only the command line, use Subversion to checkout one of your programming
assignments and then Gradle to build it.
//
Note that you may need to install some software: including the
//
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-ubuntu-16-04[Oracle
JDK]
//
and
//
https://askubuntu.com/questions/55546/how-do-i-install-svn[Subversion].
//
. *Create a new Git repository and push it to GitHub.*
//
Starting with `git init`, create a new Git repository, add some files, and then
push it to GitHub.
//
(Feel free to remove it when you're done.)
//
. *Edit a file using a command line editor.*
//
There are
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors[many choices]
//
of editors that can run entirely at the command line.
//
99% of the time it's better to fire up a GUI-based source code editor&mdash;but
there are times that you don't have that option.
//
For example, you may have to log in to a remote machine and editor some
configuration files without a monitor attached.
//
So it's important to have _some_ familiarity with commonly-available command
line text editors such as
//
http://www.vim.org/[`vim`]
//
or
//
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[`emacs`].

=== Other Fun

. *Track some system statistics.*
//
Try to figure out what processes are running on your virtual machine.
//
Pick a few and try to figure out what they are and why they are running.
//
. *Explore the internet.*
//
Install and use a few internet inspection tools.
//
For example, try to trace the path of a network packet from your machine to a
server on the west coast.
//
. *Try `tmux`.*
//
Experiment with the `tmux` terminal multiplexing utility.
//
It's quite helpful for creating and saving terminal workspaces so that you can
return to your work later, and particularly helpful when logging on to remote
machines.

[[mp7]]
== MP7 [.text-muted]#(30 Minutes)#

link:/MP/7/[MP7] is out and requires you to work in pairs with someone from your
lab section.
//
It is due _two weeks_ from now in lab.
//
Use the remainder of the lab period to find a partner and begin brainstorming
ideas for your link:/MP/7/[MP7] submission.
