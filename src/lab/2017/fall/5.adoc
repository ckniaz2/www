  Today we'll return to the morse decoding example that we used in a previous
  homework. Anything repetitive task can be better done by a computer! Let's
  teach one to decode Morse code.

//
In this lab we'll do a small programming project start to finish.
//
Our task today brings together many of the concepts that we've discussed in
class so far&mdash;data representation, loops, arrays, and algorithms.

[[exercises]]
== Written Exercises [.text-muted]#(30 Minutes)#

[.lead]
//
We begin with a short warmup designed to familiarize you with the key concepts
that we'll be using in the coding portion of the lab.

Complete this part of the lab in pairs using Google Docs.
//
Create a copy of https://goo.gl/MsVHR5[our document template], and then edit it
to record you and your partner's answers.
//
**Note that you must open this document using your @illinois.edu Google Apps
account.**
//
We will not grant access to non-Illinois users.

Have a course staff member check your answers as you go.
//
When you are done, move on to the next section.

[[decoding]]
== Programmatic Decoding [.text-muted]#(60 Minutes)#

[.lead]
//
Computer scientists are a resourceful and creative bunch footnote:[Some might
call us, at times, lazy...].
//
And one of the things that we _hate_ doing is doing things that computers do
better&mdash;which tend to be repetitive and dull anyway.

Why should I sit there with a pen and paper listening to Morse code and trying
to decode it?
//
I can teach a computer to do that, and then it'll do it all day, all night,
without errors, until the end of time.
//
That sounds like a lot more fun than doing it myself&mdash;so let's give it a
shot.
//
It turns out to be not so hard.

=== Forking the Lab5 Eclipse Project

Just as in link:/lab/4/[Lab 4] we've set up an Eclipse project for Lab 5.
//
It's on
//
https://github.com/cs125-illinois/Lab5[GitHub].

We're going to use the more common GitHub development model when you want to
make your own changes to a project.
//
First, we'll https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[_fork_] the
repository.
//
Then, we'll clone our own copy of it.
//
Once we're done, we'll be able to save our changes at the end of the lab, since
we have our own private copy of the project.
//
Follow the link:/lab/3/#forking[instructions from Lab 3].

[[approach]]
=== Our Approach

[.lead]
//
This may seem like a daunting task at first, but let's break it down into its
component parts.

We know that Morse code consists of _tones_ of different _lengths_ separated by
_silence_.
//
That naturally leads to several questions:

. How do we distinguish between tones and silence?
//
. Once we can do that, how do we distinguish between long tones (dashes) and
short tones (dots). We also need to be able to detect long periods of silence
which are used to separate characters.
//
. Once we can do that, how do we translate things from Morse code to
alphanumeric characters?

We've provided some starter code to get you going, and in particular to help you
pull audio samples out of the WAV file.
//
Use that as a starting point, and work on each of the subproblems above.
//
You'll probably find it helpful to draw pictures and compare code with other
partner groups&mdash;this is completely legal for this lab.
//
At intervals the course staff will pause and go over a solution to each of the
steps outlined above.

You will want to understand the `WavFile` library that we provide.
//
http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/audio/javaWavFiles.html[Here is some documentation
by the original author],
//
and we also have
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/wavfile/[our own package documentation
available online].

Most importantly, have fun!
//
When you are done you should be able to decode `1.wav` and `2.wav`.
//
Then take a stab at `HW0.wav`, which you decoded previously as part of our early
homework assignment.
//
That file is a bit different than the others, and you may find that you need to
fiddle with your parameters a bit to get it to work.

[[mp3]]
== Help with MP3 [.text-muted]#(20 Minutes)#

Use any remaining time in your lab section to get help with link:/MP/3/[MP3].
//
If you are finished or far along, please help others&mdash;but help them
_learn_, don't just give them the answers.
//
And if you are behind, please reach out the course staff for help.

The video walkthrough above describes how to craft the implementation of a
solution for Lab 5.
//
Note that _it does not discuss the conceptual process of arriving at how to
solve the problem_.
//
It only focuses on the implementation itself.
