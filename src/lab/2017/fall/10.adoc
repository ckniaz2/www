//
Recursion is an important and powerful programming tool.
//
At times, it can be the only way to elegantly solve a particular programming
problem.
//
But it is also a hard concept to wrap your head around.

Today's lab introduces you to recursion.
//
The written portion uses multiple simple examples to illustrate the concept, and
provides an opportunity to compare recursive and iterative solutions.
//
A big part of learning _how_ to use recursion is learning _when not_ to use it.
//
The programming component provides an opportunity to complete several simple
recursive functions on a small and useful graph.

== Written Exercises [.text-muted]#(60 Minutes)#

[.lead]
//
As usual, we begin with a written lab component.
//
Please complete these exercises carefully.
//
Your course staff will review and discuss your answers along with the rest of
your section.

Complete this part of the lab in pairs using Google Docs.
//
Create a copy of https://goo.gl/TMVW6d[our document template], and then edit it
to record you and your partner's answers.
//
**Note that you must open this document using your @illinois.edu Google Apps
account.**
//
We will not grant access to non-Illinois users.

Have a course staff member check your answers as you go.
//
When you are done, move on to the programming component.

== Practice With Recursion [.text-muted]#(30 Minutes)#

[.lead]
//
Recursion is hard to get started with, but it gets easier with
practice&mdash;like everything else you do as a programmer.
//
In the second half of the lab we'll provide you with some practice at
implementing several recursive functions.
//
We'll do this in the context of
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)[_trees_]
//
one of the more useful and interesting computer science data structures.

=== Forking the Lab10 Eclipse Project

Just as in previous labs we've set up an Eclipse project for Lab 10 on
//
https://github.com/cs125-illinois/Lab10[GitHub].
//
https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork]
//
and clone a copy of our repository as you have
//
link:/lab/3/#forking[previously].

=== Your Goal

Your goal today is to complete the `EmployeeDatabase.java` class.
//
There are some simple checkstyle errors to fix, but your main objective is to
complete two simple functions: one that counts _up_ from a given employee, the
other that counts _down_.

In both cases you are encouraged to complete both an iterative and recursive
solution to get a feeling for the design trade-offs involved.
//
When you are done, you may want to compare with another group, and discuss the
iterative-recursive trade-offs with them.
//
Do they feel the same way about their implementations as you do?
