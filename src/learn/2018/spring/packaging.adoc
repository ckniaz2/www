== Analyzing Your Solution

* What was your algorithm?
//
* What was the big-O runtime of your implementation?
//
* What are the worst- and best-case inputs for your implementation?

you'd understand _every_ line of a typical Java source file.

[[vBnPLekwLKSwctchhYVDzwDYAcHnLwtF]]
== Java Packages

[.lead]
//
A Java _package_ is a bundle of resources&mdash;mainly classes&mdash;that
provide related functionality.

[.s.small]
//
* The Java SDK provides a set of packages starting with `java` or
`javax`: like `java.util`.
//
* These _standard libraries_ are always available for
you to use when you write Java code.
//
* Other companies and organizations can create and distribute their own software
packages: like `com.google.common.math` or `org.apache.commons.text`.
//
* Unlike the standard libraries, you have to do some extra work to make these
libraries available for each project you are working on.

[[OxCNCEdjJZZhBNvuwRZYlAXXjEEarnYS]]
== Package Naming

[.lead]
//
Java establishes _naming conventions_ to ensure that multiple developers can
work on similar projects without collisions.

[.s]
//
* Standard libraries start with `java` or `javax`
//
* External libraries use a reversed domain name: `com.google...`,
`edu.illinois.cs.cs125....`, or `com.github.cs125-illinois...`.
//
* If you publish to GitHub, `com.github.<username>...` is a good choice.

== Don't Do It Yourself

You _have_ to learn to use software libraries.

== Gradle to the Rescue

[.lead]
//
There are multiple ways to make external libraries available as part of your
project. We're going to show you how to do this using
//
https://gradle.org/[_Gradle_].

[[cYGaEIKPtCRIvfHaPklwBzMbsVaErrBz]]
== What is Gradle footnote:[not "the Gradle"]?

[.lead]
//
https://gradle.org/[Gradle] is a _build tool_. It helps with things like:

[.s]
//
* building your Java program or Android app
//
* running test suites and code quality tools like `checkstyle`
//
* packaging your Java code into a _package_, if appropriate
//
* build Javadoc documentation
//
* _fetching any dependencies that your project needs_

[[DHZgxVaSgEKWRvqlfCajAZtBWZNVrVSv]]
== Example `build.gradle`

[source,groovy]
----
// We're building a Java application
apply plugin: 'java'

// Look for dependencies on jcenter
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

// We don't have any dependencies yet
dependencies {
}
----

[[pDMdxhPDDeLXxJkpQxIETxvFllmYXfWV]]
== IntelliJ Example Using Google's Guava Library

* Link to Google's Documentation: https://github.com/google/guava
//
* Link to starter code: https://github.com/cs125-illinois/lecture-packaging-app

[[nrdlFHtMGnMzOjAxtuHvcDnABgmhFzut]]
== `build.gradle` With Dependency

[source,groovy]
----
// We're building a Java application
apply plugin: 'java'

// Look for dependencies on jcenter
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

// Use the Google Guava library version 24.1-jre
dependencies {
    // When I compile the project I need this library
    compile 'com.google.guava:guava:24.1-jre'
}
----

[[UtfvqbakmGiuQxhhWGwqUmKFTMxwSCjZ]]
== Gradle Dependency Format

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.guava:guava:24.1-jre'
    // example: compile 'GROUP:ARTIFACT:VERSION'
}
----

[.lead]
//
Gradle's dependency block breaks each dependency into three parts:

[.s]
//
* `GROUP`: usually indicates an organization that provides this dependency,
like `com.google` or `com.github.cs125-illinois`.
//
* `ARTIFACT`: a string identifying the dependency to add to the project.
//
* `VERSION`: a version string identifying which version of the library to use.

[[vBbwgXiXNfHOtRkJiNElbzHnMInRkSLQ]]
== Maven Format

[.lead]
//
Sometimes you see the dependency in this format, which is used by another build
tool called Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-text</artifactId>
  <version>1.3</version>
</dependency>
----

[.s]
--
This is equivalent to `org.apache.commons:commons-text:1.3` in Gradle.
--

[[uMDkZjyFXZhwZhZfqXoWnfoHVpMvmMaF]]
== `GROUP` and `ARTIFACT`

[.lead]
//
Just be aware that these are _not necessarily_ related to the package name.

[.s]
//
* `com.google.guava:guava` provides `com.google.common.math`, etc.
//
* `com.github.cs125-illinois:sortlib` provides
`edu.illinois.cs.cs125.sortlib`

[[TOBMAZXTnIlkYxXmasplpfPNxSLWHZAs]]
== `VERSION`

[.lead]
//
Package versioning is _incredibly important_.

[.s]
//
* If you develop your app to work with `1.10.1`, it may not work with `2.0.0`.
//
* So you pin your app at a particular version of a library.
//
* However, it _is_ important to periodically update your libraries to the latest
version, but not that that may take some time and energy.

[[goAVHEprLupuCbtxiqjucUiGaOhLvtxT]]
== `.jar` Files

[.lead]
//
A single Java library usually consists of many different class files and other
resources. They are packaged into a single _Java archive_, or `.jar` file.

[[JpxSRmgPwDVseQJCohhOBUxuhMlDJRep]]
== Creating And Publishing Your Own Libraries

[.lead]
//
It's a big moment as a programmer to begin sharing your code with others.

[.s]
//
* Other people may use your code! That's exciting.
//
* They'll complain when it doesn't work. That's frustrating.
//
* They'll want you to document it carefully. That's worth doing.

[[FBroTYEaArgHKvHvMYksIfFAKKRqSwaH]]
== Packaging Your Code

Java's `package` statement allows you to put your class into a package:

[source,java,role='small']
----
// Declare that this class is part of this package
package edu.illinois.cs.cs125.sortlib;

public class Sorting {
}
----

[.s]
--
You can then import it in another project like this:

[source,java,role='mt-3 small']
----
import edu.illinois.cs.cs125.sortlib.Sorting;
----
--

[[vXEpgucrRmMSDqprWmsHQiQGwkkEjpjD]]
== Java Package Repositories

[.lead]
//
Java has several existing code repositories where developers publish their work:

* https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter[`jcenter`]
//
* https://search.maven.org/[maven Central]

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
    // Look for dependencies on jcenter
    jcenter()
    // Look for dependencies on maven Central
    mavenCentral()
}
----

[[ANglPAMGnrZetJSUgXSEwESXYnMELcsX]]
== `jitpack.io`

[.lead]
//
https://jitpack.io/[`jitpack.io`] is another example and possibly easier to use
if you are maintaining your code on GitHub.

[[xvWNIFUCQFXVNlZOvEBbsWOBJLyZRXKB]]
== IntelliJ Example Using `jitpack.io`

* Link to starter app: https://github.com/cs125-illinois/lecture-packaging-app
//
* Link to starter library: https://github.com/cs125-illinois/sortlib

[[fDPjgqUhTgtUStBDcLJJppjEUZrMDwix]]
== `build.gradle` with `jitpack.io`

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'java'

repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.guava:guava:24.1-jre'
    compile 'com.github.cs125-illinois:sortlib:0.0.1'
}

== Final Project Discussion

[.lead]
//
We've released the link:/MP/2018/spring/7/[MP7] final project specification. Here's an
overview:

[.s.small]
//
* You need to build an Android app. _If your development environment isn't
working you'll need to address that_.
//
* You need to design a simple UI. We'll provide help with that in lab.
//
* You'll need to finish your UI mockup in a week.
//
* You need to use a new web API, software library, or Android feature.
//
* You need to commit your work to GitHub.
//
* You need to work with someone in your lab section.
//
* *Other than that, what to do is up to you.*

[[ocRExoJsLsNPkSexYFyfCtQSeQEFaDoQ]]
== Final Project Evaluation

[.lead]
//
You'll demo your final project in lab during the last week of class: either 5/1
or 5/2.

[.s]
//
* You will probably need to record a YouTube video or screencast of your app so
that we can complete the app presentations in one lab section.
//
* Grading will be generous.

[[IkvaVELzwbvWqqEhuyLzeofahUfbbUDL]]
== Final Project Fair

[.lead]
//
On Thursday 5/3 (Reading Day), we'll hold our first Final Project Fair from
4&ndash;6PM in Siebel.

[.s.small]
//
* The course staff will be on hand to review the final projects and select a few
that we consider to be the most impressive.
//
* *If you had never programmed before this semester and build something simple
and cool, _that's impressive_.*
//
* Participation is optional...
//
* ...but worth 1% extra credit.
//
* We'll be handing out more extra credit to the best projects, and to the lab
sections that produce the best final projects.

[[mnObEMpNdknIiyvShibXymkmdHBUIblb]]
== Announcements

* link:/MP/2018/spring/7/[MP7 (the final project)] is out.
