== Casting

[.lead]
//
If you want to _force_ Java to convert a variable from one type to another you
can try applying a _cast_.

[source,java]
----
int i = 10;
double d = i; // This works since no information is lost
i = d; // This does not work since we'd have to throw out the fraction
i = (int) d; // But we can force Java to do it

Write a function that returns the most common character.
