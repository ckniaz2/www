== MP6 Review

[.lead]
//
We're going to do a few exercises in class today using link:/MP/2018/spring/6/[MP6].

So if you haven't already, please accept our
//
https://classroom.github.com/a/qJ5dPKlE[GitHub Classroom link]
//
and have the code up either in Android Studio (best) or on GitHub.

//
Implement a sorting algorithm of your choice...

int[] testArray = new int[] { 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 6, 4, 2 };

What did you implement?

* What's it's best and worst case runtime?

* What's it's best and worst case inputs?

== Android Hacking

[.lead]
//
Starting today you'll be hacking on Android.
//
link:/MP/2018/spring/6/[MP6] also introduces you to the {csapi}.

== Android Overview

[.lead]
//
iOS may be flashier, but Android is _the_ dominant smartphone platform on Earth
today&mdash;particularly outside the US.

[.s]
//
* _2 billion_ active monthly users (v. 700 million for iOS)
//
* 24,000 different _devices_, both phones and tablets, as of 2015 (!)
//
* 2.8 million available apps (v. 2.2 million for iOS)
//
* Programmed in Java, as well as other newer options like

== Don't Worry: You're Ready!

//
We chose Android because it's the most fun and highest impact thing you can hack
on as a Java programmer.

== How To Hack

[.lead]
//
link:/MP/2018/spring/6/[MP6] forces you to confront new and unfamiliar code
and concepts.
//
To do that well:

[.s]
//
* *Look around*
//
* *Experiment*
//
* *Iterate*
//
* *Imitate*

[[QPoDjQnftjyLMKtQhUpDIDWDTaJGXWrH]]
== Look Around

[.lead]
//
Develop loose theories about what various parts of the the code that you are
working with do.

[.s]
//
* But don't try to understand everything in detail until you need to
//
* Some parts you will need to understand...
//
* others parts you never will!
//
* When you write code for others, keep this in mind when naming functions and
providing documentation

[[taDtNXpFHStBloniQbxUHxVnVIzkaIMu]]
== Experiment

[.lead]
//
Try things!

[.s]
//
* Hacking requires a _highly experimental_ mindset
//
* Consider yourself a scientist performing experiments on an alien piece of
code: poke it in various ways, and see what happens
//
* But do good experiments: formulate hypotheses and only test one thing at a
time
//
* Nothing you do will launch any missiles!

[[DtwXqHZSRRpzfvsArldgPjVvhBEXGQHt]]
== Iterate

[.lead]
//
Making progress experimentally requires being able to iterate&mdash;try things
again and again quickly

[.s]
//
* Change one small thing, run your app, collect some data, try again
//
* The faster you can keep this loop, the better
//
* Sometimes spending even medium amounts of time on just improving your
development cycle can really pay off in the long run

[[OayIFnbWjvFlDguTtQtNAxkindjRLgxT]]
== Imitate (But Don't Copy)

[.lead]
//
Find snippets of code either in your project or elsewhere that seem useful and
understand and use them

[.s]
//
* If you can find ones that already exist in your project, that's sometimes best
since it matches the existing style and idioms
//
* If you find ones online, _don't blindly copy them_... you don't learn that way
//
* Instead, _reproduce_ them in a way that's appropriate to your goals and
project

As a reminder, we've posted

https://goo.gl/69ZyLz[a PrairieLearn "homework" assignment]

* We'll be moving quiz questions there each week
//
* It's not worth any credit...
//
* But you _should_ use it to practice for the kinds of programming questions you
should expect to see on the exam

== Announcements

* (Obviously) link:/MP/2018/spring/6/[MP6] is out, due a week from today on Friday. 40 point
early deadline next Wednesday.
//
* Get your Android environment set up! Come to office hours if you need help.
//
* We've added an
//
https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/info/feedback/[anonymous feedback form]
//
to the course website. Use it to give us feedback!
//
* My office hours continue today at 11AM in the lounge outside of Siebel 0226.
