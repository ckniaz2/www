== What Are Computers Good At?

[.s]
//
. Basic math
//
. Simple decision making
//
. Doing things over and over again very, very fast
//
. And storing data

[[BQrajZdCZObtVIdnhXcBIAtnEfNKOMpF]]
== What is a Computer?

Almost all computers share several core components:

[.lead]
//
* A CPU (central processing unit), or just a _processor_
//
* Random Access Memory (RAM), or just _memory_
//
* Stable storage, also known as a _disk_
//
* Input/Output devices, also known as _peripherals_, which include keyboards,
mice, graphics cards to drive monitors, networking cards, etc.

[[gbzyBzUJtxLAjYTlJnLgbtuUTQBcCjxZ]]
== Processors

[.lead]
//
Processors do basic math and simple decision making over and over again
_extremely quickly_.

[.s]
//
* The processor is the most _expensive_ and most _complex_ single component of most
modern computers.
//
* Processors are made from _millions_ of transistors, a basic electronic build
block that is used to create more complex circuits that can add and store data

== John Bardeen: Co-Inventor of the Transistor

[.lead]
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen[John Bardeen]
//
is the only person to win _two_ Nobel prizes in physics.

[.s.small]
//
* The first was shared with
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley[William Shockley]
//
and
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Houser_Brattain[Walter Brattain]
//
for the invention of the transistor.
//
* The transistor is right behind fire as one of the most important inventions in
human history.
//
It made modern electronics and computers possible.
//
* John Bardeen also taught here at Illinois for many years.

== What is a Transistor?

[.lead]
//
You can think of a transistor as a tiny electronic switch.

[.s]
//
* Combine a few together and you can do simple logical operators like `NOT` and
`AND`.
//
* Combine a few of those and you can create an _adder_: a circuit that adds two
numbers
//
* Combine a few of those and you can create an arithmetic logic unit, or ALU,
one of the core components of modern processors

== Moore's Law

[quote]
____
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law[Moore's law]
//
is the _observation_ that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit
doubles about every two years.
//
The observation is named after Gordon Moore.
//
____

Moore's "Law" is not a law, but rather a feat of engineering.
//
Three cheers for ECE!

== The End of Moore's Law

[.lead]
//
Until recently:

[.s]
//
* *Smaller transistors* made it possible to run chips at _lower voltages_
//
* *Lower voltages* made it possible to switch transistors _faster_
//
* Thus, *smaller transistors* led to increases in _clock speed_, and allowed
processors to complete the same calculations faster

[[rMjyxFqIebPLZkaZlUzKTIHRVEMYAjzm]]
== Until Recently

[.lead]
//
Technically Moore's Law is still going. What has broken down in known as
_Dennard Scaling_:

[quote]
____
//
Since around 2005â€“2007 Dennard scaling appears to have broken down.
//
As of 2016, transistor counts in integrated circuits are still growing, but the
resulting improvements in performance are more gradual than the speed-ups
resulting from significant frequency increases.
//
____

[[vUjpnTCpBcFlaLpfALRAjqWCvNBRgOBw]]
== What's the Culprit: _Heat_

[.lead]
//
Smaller transistors generate more heat per unit area, and at a certain point
reach a thermal density that can damage the chip itself.

[.s]
//
* Hence, we've gone from faster single processors to more cores per processor.
//
* This increases the amount of work that the computer can do through parallelism
but not the speed at which it can perform a single task.

== A Computer Full of Processors

[.lead]
//
The CPU is just one of many processors found in a typical computer.

[.s]
//
* It's the most powerful and general purpose
//
* But many other specialized processors exist, for doing things like graphics
processing, decoding MP3s or other media formats, arranging communication
between the CPU and other parts of the system, decoding or encoding network
packets, etc.

[[CtTXNLOoGaHBwLdcinhsPMDnUMRcgzTb]]
== Random Access Memory (RAM)

[.lead]
//
RAM provides high-speed volatile storage.

[.s]
//
* Like the CPU, RAM is made of millions of transistors
//
* RAM is usually faster than reading and writing data to disk...
//
* ...but it is much slower than other _caches_ that are closer to the processor
//
* RAM is _volatile_, meaning that its contents are lost when the computer is
powered down

== Non-Volatile Storage

[.lead]
//
Disks provide low-speed non-volatile storage.

[.s]
//
* Older drives (HDDs) store data magnetically on spinning platters
//
* Newer drives (SSDs) store data electronically using a new kind of transistor
//
* Disks are much slower than RAM...
//
* ...but the data that they store is retained even if the device is powered off.

== Laptops and Phones

[.lead]
//
Laptops and phones are built from the same set of core components but present
some difficult design challenges.

[.s]
//
* Everything has to be crammed into a much smaller case
//
* There's no room for a huge heat sink and fan for the processor
//
* If the processor gets very hot it can actually cause human discomfort
//
* Battery lifetime becomes a concern
