== You're In The Right Place

[[LtWPIPeLHfUwKfLHnFsAgObQiACAUHXo]]
== What Are Computers Good At?

[.s]
//
. Basic math
//
. Simple decision making
//
. Doing things over and over again very, very fast
//
. And storing data

[[trPWFBOyXxoIyQwoOOXVARxRbDjgTDiV]]
== !Basic Math

[.janini]
....
// Computers can do basic math
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
System.out.println(x + y);
int z = x + y + 1;
System.out.println(z);
....

[[jNWKvrYryTeCmYMFWxKGefQqBHvgmTGc]]
== !Simple Decision Making

[.janini]
....
// Computers can make simple decisions
int temperature =
if (temperature < 32 && temperature >= 0) {
  System.out.print("It's cold");
} else if (temperature < 0) {
  System.out.println("It's really cold");
}
....

== !Computers Can Repeat Over And Over Quickly

[.janini]
....
// Computers can perform many, many calculations extremely quickly.
long i = 0;
while (i < 10000000L) {
  i++;
}
System.out.println("Finished");

*All things you _aren't_ good at!*

== Your Perfect Complement

[.lead]
//
*Together you can solve any problem.*

[[ewZnhvFaDvLRFqtxGvxMDYXmyMBcigzt]]
== Concept and Craft

[.lead]
//
Computer science is both a _conceptual_ and an _applied_ discipline.

[.s]
//
* *Concepts*: computer science has deep roots in mathematics and explores the
fundamental heart of problem solving
//
* *Craft*: as you learn computer science, you learn the most powerful skill on
Earth: programming.

[[RAnQjIUlgLetUIYHXrFketYnumiEsMhC]]
== Concepts

[.s]
//
* *Algorithms*: ways of solving problems and what makes certain problems hard
//
* *Representation*: representing data so that computers can manipulate it
//
* *Recursion*: breaking down problems into smaller, manageable pieces

[[CrGzONxvmobDiCzYtqUUZBrkSdXFTmsK]]
== Craft

[.s]
//
* *Imperative programming*: solving problems using constructs like
loops and conditional expressions
//
* *Object-oriented programming*: design patterns for starting to work on larger
software projects
//
* *Software development*: design, style, debugging, testing, and other core
software development competencies

[[FYXOUkfcCLrPKUjFqEYcvaKpyIwhHLBe]]
== Don't Tell Anyone: Programming Is Fun

[.s]
//
* *Really fun.* It's an ultimate mental challenge and a full left-right brain
workout.
//
* Once you get good at it, it'll be one of your favorite things to do.
//
And you can change the world. So there's that.

[[onGoAtMItLsYctSxAvdkkXunzesajYla]]
== Creations

Computer scientists have built some incredible things!
//
So we'll try to find time to talk about things like:

* The internet
//
* Google
//
* Computer hardware
//
* Artificial intelligence
//
* And something that you might suggest! We're open to ideas.

== Cheating

[.lead]
//
I take academic integrity extremely seriously.
//
Cheaters will be caught and punished.

== Lectures

[.s]
//
* Lectures are taught in an active learning style. We'll spend our time reading
and writing code together, just like the examples we started class with.
//
* If you have a laptop, *bring it with you*. If you don't, we'll make
accommodations.
//
* *There will frequently be pre-lecture readings or activities to complete*
//
* You'll receive credit for being in the right place at the right time and
following along and participating

[[cOHlQcYpxtJTpTzbPIlINKtGFgMBZuMk]]
== MPs

[.lead]
//
Programming is about practice. Period.

The programming assignments&mdash;known at CS@Illinois as _machine
problems_&mdash;are an enormous part of how you learn the material.
//
Start them early, get help as needed, and don't give up! The more you work at
them, the more you learn.

[[hptvBcPwwAHmrXIznsTSPLRlWaaHmBdV]]
== Beginner's Rule

[.s]
* Many of you are beginners, but not all of you.
//
* If you're new and you meet someone that seems much better than you&mdash;they
have probably just had more practice.

* Don't get discouraged!
//
*But the only way to catch up is to keep practicing.*
//
* You _will_ get better. And it gets fun _fast_...

[[ieEYXAwbaNJUaEBgXOYZFrmXIZHeRaki]]
== How To Succeed in CS 125

[.s]
//
. Prepare for, attend, and participate in your assigned lecture and lab section
//
. Start the MPs early and make a regular appointment to come to office hours
//
. Don't miss the weekly quizzes in the CBTF&mdash;they start this week
