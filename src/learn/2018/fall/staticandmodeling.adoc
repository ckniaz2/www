== Midterm Review: String Processing

A common task when working with is extracting data from structured text.
//
For example, consider that you are provided employee records in the following
format:

```text
Name:Position:Salary
```

Here are some examples:

```text
Chuchu Challen:Senior Challen Family Dog:10000
Xyz Challen:Junior Challen Family Cat: 8000
Little Helper:Challen Family Roomba
```

== Midterm Review: String Processing

**Note that not every record has all possible fields.**
//
(Little Helper works in exchange for free electricity.)
//
In addition, some records may have whitespace around the values, as in the data
for "Xyz Challen" above.

[[LGoieNVuJpiZFIdQNNyKZczeRRAliCCq]]
== Midterm Review: String Processing

Your job is to write a function called `getSalary` that, given a record in the
format above passed as a `String`, returns that person's salary as an `int`.
//
If the record does not contain a salary or if the record is `null` you should
return `-1`.

As a reminder we provided a copy of the Java `String` documentation on the quiz
cover page.
//
You may want to refer to that, and in particular to the `split` and `trim`
functions.
//
Note that you can pass a `String` to `split` rather than a regular expression,
and it will split the string at each occurrence of the passed `String`.

[[nuKMZnDsVysyNvedTiPlndMSnxfatCoA]]
== Midterm Review: String Processing

We have also provided a copy of the Java `Integer` documentation on the quiz
cover page.
//
You should examine the `Integer.parseInt` function to convert a
`String` into an `int`:

```java
int i = Integer.parseInt("10");
```

However, note that this function _will not work_ if there is whitespace
surrounding the integer.
//
So you'll need to remove it.
//
See the `String` hints above.

== Midterm Review: GCD

Define and implement a function below called `gcd` that returns the greatest
common denominator (GCD) as an `int` of an array of passed positive `int` values.
//
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more integers, which are not all
zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers.
//
The passed array may be `null`, empty, or contain only 0s&mdash;in these cases return `-1`.

[[qlBiCcBerzeaQluXldiNDWLzEQZPLjQb]]
== Midterm Review: GCD

**You do not need to implement a sophisticated GCD algorithm.**
//
A simple iterative solution will work fine.
//
Once you have dealt with the bad inputs (`null`, empty) you may want to try to
implement the following algorithm:

[.small.s]
//
. First, find the maximum value over the passed array.
//
This is also the place to see if you have been given all zeroes.
//
. Now, start at that value and work downward.
//
. For each potential GCD, find the remainder when you divide every element in
the input array by the potential GCD.
//
If they are all zero, you have found the GCD.
//
If any is non-zero, move on to the next potential value.

`static` methods and variables belong to the _class_, not to a specific
instance.

== `static`, `public`, and `private`

[.lead]
//
`public` and `private` also work on static variables and methods

[.s]
//
* `public`: the (static) variable can be read or written by anyone
//
* `private`: the (static) variable can only read or written by methods defined _on that
class_
//
* `public`: the (static) method can be called by anyone
//
* `private`: the (static) method can only be called by other methods _on that class_

We can also use a class method to be able to return `null` when creating a new
object if invalid parameters are supplied.
