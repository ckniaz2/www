== Internet As Wired Infrastructure

[.lead]
//
The internet comprises an enormous amount of physical infrastructure.

[.s]
//
* *Most of it is _wired_, not wireless.* Wireless is mainly used for the first
hop.
//
* *Most of it is _fiber_ (glass), not copper.* Signals degrade quickly in copper
but travel faster and with less attenuation in glass footnote:[This is why
https://www.dow.com/en-us/electrical/markets/telecommunications/fiber-optic-cable[Dow
Corning] has such a nice visitor center!]. Copper is only used for the last 100
meters.
//
* *The internet wouldn't exist without fiber optic cable.* It's one of the
wonders of the modern world. It's not just glass, it's _really clear_ glass.

== An Internet Journey

[.lead]
If you want to learn more, you can join me as we follow a cable from my former
office to the edge of our campus network.

* https://youtu.be/KHvHCnRCWYc[First hop out of my office]
//
* https://youtu.be/uPyWqblKuYs[Next hop to the network closet on my floor].
//
Here copper gives way to fiber.
//
* https://youtu.be/2DC1fYjURag[My next hop in the basement networking closet]
//
* https://youtu.be/5p6DdQCPh7Q[My last hop on campus].
//
At this point all of the campus network traffic leaves on only a few slim fiber
optic cable.

== Internet As Wireless Infrastructure

[.lead]
//
In recent years we've also built out a huge amount of _wireless_ internet
infrastructure.

[.s]
//
* *Short range wireless* is dominated by
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi[WiFi]
//
and what you use when you're on campus, at home, or at a coffee shop
//
* *Medium-range wireless* is used to provide connectivity to mobile devices like
smartphones over longer distances.
//
You usually buy this from a cellular provider like Verizon or Sprint.

[.lead]

The result is that by connecting a computer to the internet, you are now
connected to _4 billion_ other computers.

[.s]
//
* Many times the first connection is _wireless_
//
* But after that point there is literally a wire that you can follow from your
computer to the other computer

== The Internet Protocol (IP)

[.lead]
//
The
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol[Internet Protocol (IP)]
//
consists of a series of agreements that allow internet-connected devices to
communicate.

[.s]
//
* *What do we call each other?*
//
IP specifies the format of internet protocol addresses, also called IP
addresses.
** Here's one: `192.17.96.8` (IPv4)
** Here's a new one: `2607:f8b0:4009:807::2004` (IPv6)
//
* *How are our message structured?*
//
IP specifies a _format_ for each message (or datagram) exchanged across the
internet.

including Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn.

*They changed the world.*

== HTTP: `GET` Request

[.lead]
//
HTTP defines how web browsers request (`GET`) content:

When you type
//
http://cs125-illinois.github.io/lecture-webapis-examples/simple.html[`http://cs125-illinois.github.io/lecture-webapis-examples/simple.html`]
//
into your browser, it sends a message to `cs125-illinois.github.io` that looks
like this:

[source]
----
GET /lecture-webapis-examples/simple.html HTTP/1.1
Host: cs125-illinois.github.io
----

[[xMoFkJGPpBflVvnxoNQxSyVAJzUNENBT]]
== `GET` Parameters

[.lead]
//
You can send some data to the server in a `GET` request using _query
parameters_.

[.s.small]
//
* These follow the path and an `?` sign in the URL
//
* Each takes the form `key=value`
//
* Key-value pairs are separated by `&` delimiters
//
* Here's an example: `search?safe=off&source=hp&q=cs125`:
** `safe=off`
** `source=hp`
** `q=cs125`

[[qBHMBGGzPiPgkvlLhCFGzgFiFJfxjBNh]]
== HTTP: `GET` Response

[.lead]
//
If the request succeeds, the server responds with something that looks like
this:

[source]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:56:53 GMT
Last-Modified: Sat, 20 Nov 2014 07:16:26 GMT
Content-Length: 44
Content-Type: text/html

<html>
  <body>
    ...
----

[[msLpSFZesNttCvPreqQKvJoRnCFjHEjE]]
== HTTP: `POST` Request

[.lead]
//
HTTP also defines how web browsers submit information (`POST`):

When you submit the form on
//
http://cs125-illinois.github.io/lecture-webapis-examples/form.html[`http://cs125-illinois.github.io/lecture-webapis-examples/form.html`],
//
it sends a message to `cs125-illinois.github.io` that looks like this:

[source]
----
POST /lecture-webapis-examples/simple.html HTTP/1.1
Host: cs125-illinois.github.io

text=word
----

Note that this fails on `github.io` because it only serves _static_ pages and
doesn't deal with data provided by users.

[[gzVWnKntRdaWetSwyLuadYFPntJXusHU]]
== HTTP: `GET` and `POST`

[.lead]
//
HTTP defines many other types of requests, but `GET` and `POST` are by far the
most common.

[.s]
//
* *Every time you load a web page* it starts with a `GET`, and usually that's
followed by many other `GET` requests to fetch others parts of the page: style
sheets, images, JavaScript code.
//
* *Every time you submit a form* it uses a `POST` to send data to the server, at
which point your Facebook comment is recorded, or your credit card is charged
and an package starts its way toward your house

[[MKWZqVVGklEKImCOLjMlSstXeLBUXybc]]
== HTTP: `GET` v `POST`

[.lead]
//
The HTTP protocol specifies different semantics for `GET` and `POST`:

[.s]
//
* `GET` _should not_ change anything about the world, just return a document
//
* `POST` _should_ change something about the world&mdash;create a new account,
pay your bill, purchase something, send a message, etc.
//
* As a result it is _safe_ to repeat a `GET` but potentially _problematic_ to
repeat a `POST`: hence the "Do not click back" and "Do not submit this form
twice" kind of warnings.
