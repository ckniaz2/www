== Internet As Wired Infrastructure

[.lead]
//
The internet comprises an enormous amount of physical infrastructure.

[.s]
//
* *Most of it is _wired_, not wireless.* Wireless is mainly used for the first
hop.
//
* *Most of it is _fiber_ (glass), not copper.* Signals degrade quickly in copper
but travel faster and with less attenuation in glass footnote:[This is why
https://www.dow.com/en-us/electrical/markets/telecommunications/fiber-optic-cable[Dow
Corning] has such a nice visitor center!]. Copper is only used for the last 100
meters.
//
* *The internet wouldn't exist without fiber optic cable.* It's one of the
wonders of the modern world. It's not just glass, it's _really clear_ glass.

[.s]
//
* *Short range wireless* is dominated by

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi[WiFi]
//
and what you use when you're on campus, at home, or at a coffee shop
//
* *Medium-range wireless* is used to provide connectivity to mobile devices like
smartphones over longer distances.

//
consists of a series of agreements that allow internet-connected devices to
communicate.

[.s]
//
* *What do we call each other?*

IP specifies the format of internet protocol addresses, also called IP
addresses.
** Here's one: `192.17.96.8` (IPv4)
** Here's a new one: `2607:f8b0:4009:807::2004` (IPv6)
//
* *How are our message structured?*

== HTTP: `GET` Request

[.lead]
//
HTTP defines how web browsers request (`GET`) content:

When you type
//
http://cs125-illinois.github.io/lecture-webapis-examples/simple.html[`http://cs125-illinois.github.io/lecture-webapis-examples/simple.html`]
//
into your browser, it sends a message to `cs125-illinois.github.io` that looks
like this:

[source]
----
GET /lecture-webapis-examples/simple.html HTTP/1.1
Host: cs125-illinois.github.io
----

[[xMoFkJGPpBflVvnxoNQxSyVAJzUNENBT]]
== `GET` Parameters

[.lead]
//
You can send some data to the server in a `GET` request using _query
parameters_.

[.s.small]
//
* These follow the path and an `?` sign in the URL
//
* Each takes the form `key=value`
//
* Key-value pairs are separated by `&` delimiters
//
* Here's an example: `search?safe=off&source=hp&q=cs125`:
** `safe=off`
** `source=hp`
** `q=cs125`

[[qBHMBGGzPiPgkvlLhCFGzgFiFJfxjBNh]]
== HTTP: `GET` Response

[.lead]
//
If the request succeeds, the server responds with something that looks like
this:

[source]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 08 Apr 2018 08:56:53 GMT
Last-Modified: Sat, 20 Nov 2014 07:16:26 GMT
Content-Length: 44
Content-Type: text/html

<html>
  <body>
    ...
----

[[msLpSFZesNttCvPreqQKvJoRnCFjHEjE]]
== HTTP: `POST` Request

[.lead]
//
HTTP also defines how web browsers submit information (`POST`):

When you submit the form on
//
http://cs125-illinois.github.io/lecture-webapis-examples/form.html[`http://cs125-illinois.github.io/lecture-webapis-examples/form.html`],
//
it sends a message to `cs125-illinois.github.io` that looks like this:

[source]
----
POST /lecture-webapis-examples/simple.html HTTP/1.1
Host: cs125-illinois.github.io

text=word
----

Note that this fails on `github.io` because it only serves _static_ pages and
doesn't deal with data provided by users.

[[gzVWnKntRdaWetSwyLuadYFPntJXusHU]]
== HTTP: `GET` and `POST`

[.lead]
//
HTTP defines many other types of requests, but `GET` and `POST` are by far the
most common.

[.s]
//
* *Every time you load a web page* it starts with a `GET`, and usually that's
followed by many other `GET` requests to fetch others parts of the page: style
sheets, images, JavaScript code.
//
* *Every time you submit a form* it uses a `POST` to send data to the server, at
which point your Facebook comment is recorded, or your credit card is charged
and an package starts its way toward your house

[[MKWZqVVGklEKImCOLjMlSstXeLBUXybc]]
== HTTP: `GET` v `POST`

[.lead]
//
The HTTP protocol specifies different semantics for `GET` and `POST`:

[.s]
//
* `GET` _should not_ change anything about the world, just return a document
//
* `POST` _should_ change something about the world&mdash;create a new account,
pay your bill, purchase something, send a message, etc.
//
* As a result it is _safe_ to repeat a `GET` but potentially _problematic_ to
repeat a `POST`: hence the "Do not click back" and "Do not submit this form
twice" kind of warnings.

[[ENeAbNYgDNrbwqRpHZJduekhgMOdxOow]]
== Web Page Contents: HTML

[.lead]
//
HTML defines how each page is _structured_:

[source,html,role='small']
----
<h1>This is a Simple Web Page</h1>

<p>
  HTML includes both content and instructions to the browser determining
  how the content should look. For example, the following items should be
  in a numbered list:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
  <li>Third</li>
</ol>

<p>
  <strong>Here is some bold text.</strong> <i>And this in italics.</i>

[[jusdaKZZdKzMfBIQchXrTXKenbeDgzBl]]
== Web Evolution

[.lead]
//
The web has gone through many design changes over the years.

[.s.small]
//
* *Static Sites*: the web server returns a _file_ from the disk that contains a
complete web document
** Example: most of `cs125.cs.illinois.edu` is a static website
//
* *Dynamic Sites*: the web server _runs code_ to produce an HTML document and
respond to `POST` requests created by forms
** Example: sites like `my.cs.illinois.edu` are dynamic sites
//
* *Web Apps*: most of the site is _generated by JavaScript_ that runs in the
user's browser, with the server providing data as needed
** Examples: `cs125.cs.illinois.edu/m/grades`, Discourse, Gmail, Google Docs

== So What's a Web _API_?

== What's An API?

[quote]
____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface[In computer
programming, an application programming interface (API)]
//
is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building
application software.
____

In English, an _API_ is a set of functions that perform a set of related and
useful tasks.

[[VhKcyDdXgMnfeOXUFUtqYTEIXFRxBmua]]
== Example API

[.lead]
//
Let's say we wanted to find out the weather at a particular location:

[source,java]
----
// Get the current weather a particular location
static WeatherInfo getAtLocation(WeatherLocation location)

// Get the current weather a particular location and a particular time
static WeatherInfo getAtLocation(WeatherLocation location, Date date)

// Get a list of possible WeatherInfo objects for a given location string
static WeatherLocation[] searchLocations(String query)
----

[[JLNFoBPiCoEGSAeKEmLVCEayqKYizNUm]]
== Web APIs

[.lead]
//
A _web API_ is just an API that you access over the web. Consider that:

[.s]
//
* We can send data to a web server using `POST` and also using URL parameters in
a `GET` request
//
* The web server can run code in response
//
* And return a response, [.s]#_which does not have to be an HTML document_#
//
* And in many cases custom internet protocols are blocked by firewalls, making
it attractive to run APIs over HTTP

[[sQoshKdkerQbElGQyoWmkEymnLkzrZKF]]
== Web APIs: Sending Arguments

[source,java,role="small"]
----
// Get the current weather a particular location
static WeatherInfo getAtLocation(WeatherLocation location)
----

To send the `location` argument to the `getAtLocation` function over the web we
have several options:

[.s.small]
//
* Stick it the URL: `/api/getAtLocation/(location)/`, which can be mapped to a
function call
//
* Add it as a query parameter: `/api/getAtLocation?location=(location)`
//
* Use a `POST` request and put it in the body, possibly as JSON:

[source,role="small s"]
----
POST /api/getAtLocation/

{
  "location": (location)
}
----

[[ijoYpJSPQQLblMzMSckYOpVMqASJepju]]
== Web APIs: Returning Results

[source,java,role="small"]
----
// Get the current weather a particular location
static WeatherInfo getAtLocation(WeatherLocation location)
----

In many cases web APIs return results using _JSON_ (JavaScript Object Notation):

[source,json,role='small']
----
{
  "consolidated_weather": [
  {
    "id": 6511056423747584,

== What is REST?

[.lead]
//
You'll often hear of REST or RESTful web APIs.

[.s.small]
//
* REST is a _design pattern_ for creating web APIs.
//
* URLs map to resources: so `GET` `/products` returns a list of all products,
while `GET` `/products/10` get information about product with ID 10
//
* HTTP verbs are meaningful: `GET` gets something, `POST` creates a new entity,
`DELETE` removes one, etc.
//
* HTTP response codes are meaningful: 200 is `OK`, 405 is not authorized, etc.
//
* The bodies of requests and responses are in `JSON`

== Internet Design Principles

[.lead]
//
The internet established many powerful and important _design principles_.
//
One of the most important is the _end-to-end principle_:

[quote]
____
In networks designed according to the
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle[end-to-end principle],
//
application-specific features reside in the communicating end nodes of the
network, rather than in intermediary nodes, such as gateways and routers, that
exist to establish the network.
____

[[lTVxOqKIJeqpxtlWpxSuzjPINWGWZOwK]]
== End-to-End Example: Reliable Delivery

[.lead]
//
Reliable delivery is _not guaranteed_ by the core Internet Protocol.

[.s]
//
* Not every application needs it!
//
* Moved to the _endpoints_: that is, implemented on your device and whatever
computer you want to communicate with reliably.

[[GiuISzhloTQxbzcjHBBhFhJAzWSOnGUx]]
== End-to-End Principle: Consequences

[.lead]
//
The end-to-end principles has had powerful implications for internet design and
evolution.

[.s]
//
* The core network stays simple
//
* The core network _doesn't choose winners and losers_

[[WsnIIRchesWsJjxchaCCShmRJuhiaGML]]
== Net Neutrality

[.lead]
//
Net neutrality is essentially enshrining the end-to-end principle in law.

[.s]

where it comes from, where it is going, or other features
//
* *This keeps the internet available for the kinds of transformative innovation
it has supported since its creation.*
