== CS 125 App (New Fall 2018)

Our CS 125 App tracks the proximity of course staff and students to known course
locations like office hours and Geoff's office (Siebel 2227).
//
The cross-platform app is built using
//
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/[React Native],
//
with a
//
https://redux.js.org/[Redux store]
//
for local state management and
//
http://meteor.com/[Meteor]
//
for remote state management.
