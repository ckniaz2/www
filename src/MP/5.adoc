[.lead]

Recursion is an important and powerful programming technique.
Sometimes it is the best way to solve a problem, and sometimes it is almost _the
only_ way to solve a problem.

Recursion can be tricky to wrap your head around at first, but as usual the best
way to get comfortable with this technique is to practice.
For MP5 you'll analyze chemicals represented as recursive data structures.
You will use recursive and iterative functions,
and apply recursive problem solving technique by breaking down a large task into
several smaller ones.
MP5 is the second of two Android assignments to prepare you for your final
project.

*MP5 is due Friday 11/16/2018 @ 5PM.
To receive full credit, you must submit by this deadline.*
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP5 is for submitting code that earns at least
_40 points_ by *Monday 11/12/2018 @ 5PM.*

As usual, late submissions will be subject to the
link:/info/syllabus/#regrading[MP late submission policy].

[[objectives]]
== Learning Objectives

MP5 gives you plenty of practice with recursive programming.
You'll work with existing data structures like you did in link:/MP/4/[MP4],
write member functions like you did in link:/MP/3/[MP3],
use collections like the arrays you used in link:/MP/2/[MP2],
work with strings like in link:/MP/1/[MP1],
and of course continue to use the imperative programming constructs introduced in link:/MP/0[MP0].

The main task in MP5 is naming simple organic molecules.
Writing one function to handle all molecules would be **extremely hard**.
Fortunately, the task can be broken down into several smaller tasks that are _easy_ to implement!
"Factoring out" smaller, repeated pieces of functionality into helper functions
is a critical skill when writing larger, more complex programs.
Our test cases are designed to guide you as you build up your solution
to handle more and more kinds of molecules.

[[structure]]
== Assignment Structure

Like MP4, MP5 is split into two modules:

* `/lib/`: a library that performs various analyses of the given molecule.
*This library is the only part of the MP tested by the test suite.*
* `/app/`: an Android app for you to use for your own interactive testing.
The Android app is technically functional, but could use a few modifications from you.
And, for it to work correctly, you need to finish the library in `lib`.

Your primary job is to complete the required analyses in `MoleculeAnalyzer.java`.

The molecule to analyze is provided for you in the form of a `BondedAtom` object.
This data structure is recursively defined,
so even though one `BondedAtom` instance only represents a single atom,
you can use its instance methods to get references to other atoms and
thereby explore the entire molecule.
Every atom also has a `ChemicalElement` object with some information on its element.

**Don't know chemistry?**
//
That's OK!
//
This page has thorough explanations of everything you need to know to complete
the MP.
//
Ask on the {forum} if you'd like any clarifications.
//
--

Your analysis functions are called by the app and, once you complete them, your
app will be almost completely functional&mdash;and we'll be happy to help you
with the rest.

As always, you will find our official
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP5-Starter/[MP5 online documentation]
//
helpful in understanding what each function and class does.

[[getting]]
=== Obtaining MP5

We are again using link:/MP/setup/android-studio[Android Studio] for MP5.

In *Android Studio*, use
link:https://classroom.github.com/a/TODO[this GitHub classroom invitation link]
to fork your copy of MP5.
Once your repository has been created, import it into Android Studio following
link:/MP/setup/git/#workflow[our assignment Git workflow guide].

[[requirements]]
=== Your Goal

At this point you should be familiar with the requirements from previous MPs.
For the points breakdown, see the <<grading, grading description below>>.

[[approach]]
== Approaching MP5

Getting 100 points on MP5 doesn't take a ton of code.
But some of it is _recursive_ code, so it will take you longer.
Don't expect to make as much progress writing recursive code when you are
getting started.
It's tricky, and takes practice.
Slow down and focus on applying the recursive design principles that we've
taught in lecture and in lab.

=== Understand The Requirements

Just like with previous MPs,
//
https://blog.codinghorror.com/because-reading-is-fundamental-2/[reading is
fundamental]
//
to your success.
//
Understand the
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP5-Starter/[specification]
//
and the remainder of this section.
//
Read those first.
//
Then read them again.

=== Designing Recursive Functions

Recall the guidelines for designing recursive functions that we presented in lab
and lecture:

. *Every recursive function must have a base case.*
//
If you don't stop recursing, you will eventually run out of memory and your
program will crash.
//
So there must be some case where you do not call yourself again.
//
. *The base case must be reached.*
//
As a corollary to the above, every set of recursive calls must eventually
_reach_ the base case.
//
Otherwise (again) your program will recurse infinitely, run out of memory and
crash.
//
. *The problem should get smaller each time.*
//
Each recursive step should reduce the size of the problem somehow.
//
This can happen in several ways.
//
In Fibonacci, for example, we reduce the size of the problem by reduction toward
known starting values.
//
When processing trees, we reduce the size of the problem by splitting the tree
into several subtrees which are considered separately.
//
How this happens depends on the problem, but it does need to happen somehow.

It can also be helpful to consider simple cases.
//
How do you reverse a list with only one element?
//
Now, extend that to a list with two elements, then three.
//
You may begin to see a pattern emerge that helps you understand how to design
your recursive approach.

[[datastructures]]
=== Helpful Data Structures

As you learned in lecture,
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html[``ArrayList``]s
are like arrays whose length can be easily changed.
You'll make extensive use of these list methods:

* `add` adds a new item at the end, extending the list's length by 1
* `get` gets the element at the given index, much like indexing into an array
* `set` replaces the element at the given index with a new item, much like assigning
to a position in an array
* `size` gets the current length of the list, just like the `length` field of an array

It's also possible to `remove` elements from a list, decreasing the size by 1
and shifting the indexes of any subsequent items down by 1.
One overload of `remove` takes an `int` and removes the item at that index;
the other overload takes an object and removes its first occurrence from the list,
wherever it may be.

Often it is useful to associate one kind of object with another
so that you can easily look up the corresponding value for a given identifier.
In the real world, dictionaries let you look up the definition of a given word.
The university's systems look up information about you given your NetID or UIN.
In computer science, we often talk about such mappings as being from "keys" to "values."
So in the dictionary example, words would be the keys and definitions would be the values:
you look up the definition from the word.

A commonly used implementation of mappings in Java is
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html[`HashMap`].
Like arrays and lists, hash maps can deal with any Java data type.
Since the keys and values can be of different types, you need to specify both of them.
A `HashMap<String, Pet>` maps _from_ strings _to_ ``Pet``s, for example.
We might use one to look up pets by their name, like this:

[source,java]
----
HashMap<String, Pet> pets = new HashMap<>(); // Create an empty HashMap
pets.put("Chuchu", new Dog()); // Associate "Chuchu" with a new dog object
pets.put("Xyz", new Cat()); // Likewise add Xyz to the map

// Suppose we later want to look up a pet by its name
Pet xyz = pets.get("Xyz"); // Get the pet corresponding to the name "Xyz"
----

Common map operations include:

* `get` finds the value associated with a given key (or null of the key isn't in the map)
* `put` adds a key-value pair (or replaces the value of an existing pair if the key already exists)
* `remove` removes the mapping of the given key
* `keySet` gets a collection of all the keys in the mapping, which can be iterated over
using the enhanced for-each loop syntax (useful for doing something with every entry)

**Hint:** Just like how arrays can contain arrays (e.g. `RGBAPixel[][]`),
both these data structures can contain other data structures.
You can have a `HashMap<String, ArrayList<Integer>>`, for example, which
is a mapping from strings to lists of integers.

Refer to the respective Javadoc pages to see more features of these useful classes.

[[functions]]
=== Helpful Helper Functions

The helper functions you (hopefully) wrote in MP4 were more general than the graded functions.
Oftentimes, though, helper functions only "factor out" small pieces of work from
other functions.
MP5 will be dramatically easier if you design and use good helper functions.
The reference solution (including extra credit) uses _16_ private functions,
of which all are involved in naming and many are implemented in terms of others.
These are the tasks they factor out:

* Recursively explore the molecule and produce a list of the atoms in it
* Search for a ring and, if present, return a list of the carbons in the cycle
* Rotate and/or flip the ring so that the carbons are in the correct order for substituent numbering
* Find a list of all possible carbon backbones (assumes a linear molecule)
* Select the correct linear carbon backbone for substituent numbering
* Compare two proposed backbones (assumed to be the same length)
  and return the better one according to priority rules
* Compare many proposed backbones and select the best one according to priority rules
* Name all the non-end-group substituents on a given carbon atom
* Name the non-end-group substituent starting at the given atom
* Name the end-group substituent, if any, on the given tip carbon (assumes a linear molecule)
* Count the total number of low-priority substituents on a proposed backbone
* Determine whether a given backbone carbon has any substituents
* Count the low-priority substituents on a given carbon
* Count the high-priority substituents on a given carbon
* Determine whether an atom is a substituent to a given backbone
* Combine a list of substituent positions into a comma-delimited string

As you can see, though the naming task (especially with extra credit) is complex,
it can be broken down into many smaller, easier tasks, many of which can be further broken down.
If you get stuck on a big task, try writing a helper function that solves a smaller part!

[[help]]
=== Getting Help

The course staff is ready and willing to help you every step of the way!
Please come to link:/info/syllabus/#calendar[office hours], or post on the
{forum} when you need help.
You should also feel free to help each other, as long as you do not violate the
<<cheating, academic integrity requirements>>.

[[chemistry]]
== Chemistry Tutorial

Programming is a powerful skill for many reasons, one of which is that it can be
applied to virtually any science.
//
Bioinformatics&mdash;the processing of biological data, especially genetic
sequences&mdash;was critical to the Human Genome Project, for example.
//
In this MP, you'll be applying your programming skills to chemistry.
//
Nevertheless, we don't require or expect you to have a deep background in
chemistry, so this section tells you exactly what you need to know to complete
the assignment
//
footnote:[We're therefore skipping over a lot of interesting stuff. You can
learn all the cool details by taking a chemistry class!].

=== Basics

All molecules are composed of multiple atoms.
//
Every atom in a molecule has at least one bond to another atom in that same
molecule.
//
Hydrogen gas, for example, consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to each other.
//
In larger molecules, each atom can have multiple bonds, but each bond always
connects exactly two atoms.

The number of bonds an atom makes depends on what _element_ it is.
//
We call the number of bonds an element wants its
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)[_valence_].
//
Oxygen wants two bonds, for example.
//
Depending on the number of electrons shared, bonds can be single, double, or
triple&mdash;we'll only concern ourselves with single and double bonds.
//
The oxygen molecules you breathe each consist of two oxygen atoms connected to
each other by a double bond, so atom is involved in exactly the number of bonds
it wants to be.
//
If an atom has more or fewer bonds than is appropriate for its valence it is
considered to be _charged_.

Different elements have different weights&mdash;for example, a carbon atom is
heavier than a hydrogen atom.
//
All atoms of a given element have roughly
//
footnote:[not exactly due to
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope[_isotopes_]]
//
the same weight.
//
You can determine the _molecular weight_ of a molecule simply by adding up all
the weights of the atoms in it.

Each element has a one- or two-letter symbol that is used to denote it in
drawings and formulas.
//
You may recognize these from the link:https://www.ptable.com/[periodic table].
For example, "O" is the symbol for oxygen.
//
This MP uses only six elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine,
and bromine.
//
Those last three are all _halogens_&mdash;we'll come back to that.

We're focusing on _organic_ molecules for this MP.
//
All organic molecules involve carbon, generally arranged in chains with a bunch
of hydrogens and sometimes a few other atoms connected to them.
//
The simplest organic molecule is methane, one carbon atom with four hydrogen
atoms connected to it by one single bond each:

----
  H
  |
H-C-H
  |
  H
----

=== Drawing

The app code we've given you handles the drawing of molecules, but the rest of
this section has illustrations of the kind of molecules we'll ask your code to
name.
//
So you should know how to interpret these drawings.

Since organic molecules often contain a lot of hydrogen atoms and quite a few
carbons, always identifying those atoms as "H" and "C" in drawings is a pain.
//
So organic chemists use
//
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_formula[skeletal formulas]
//
to keep things tidy.
//
Skeletal formulas never explicitly show carbon&mdash;it's assumed that the unlabeled
tips, kinks, and intersections of lines are carbon atoms.
//
Likewise, hydrogens
attached to carbon atoms are not shown&mdash;it's assumed that every carbon has the
right number of hydrogens on it to fill its valence.

So this (carbons circled in red)...

image::Propane.png[role='img-fluid']

...is the same molecule as this...

----
  H H H
  | | |
H-C-C-C-H
  | | |
  H H H
----

Elements other than carbon and hydrogen are known as _heteroatoms_ and are shown
on drawings by their symbol.
//
Hydrogens bonded directly to heteroatoms are explictly shown on the diagram,
like this:

image::HeteroatomExample.png[role='img-fluid']

=== Intro to Naming

When talking out loud or writing in plain text, it's not possible to draw a
structure.
//
Instead, the molecule under discussion must be named.
//
Of course, the name needs to be descriptive enough that the molecule can be
unambiguously identified.
//
Ideally each molecule would only have one standard name.
//
Naming things in computer science is also a challenge.
//
There is a famous saying that there are only
//
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html[two hard problems in computer
science]:
//
cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.

The
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry[
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]
//
(IUPAC) decided the standard rules for chemical names.
//
Since so many molecules are possible, the rules are quite extensive.
//
We present a version of the standard that is simplified but correct for naming
the molecules checked by the test cases.

Since carbon is the backbone of organic molecules, the number of carbons in the
molecule sets the backbone for its name.
//
Every chain length has a name.
//
The names of simple carbon-or-hydrogen-only molecules always end in "ane."
//
"Meth" is the name for a one-carbon chain, hence "methane" for the one-carbon
molecule discussed above.
//
The name for a two-carbon chain is "eth," so the molecule with two carbons fully
saturated with hydrogens is "ethane."
//
The chain base names from 1 to 10 are given in the starter code.

This is hexane, which has six carbons:

image::Hexane.png[role='img-fluid']

[.alert.alert-success]
//
--
//
To pass `testNamingSimpleStraight`, you only need to determine how many carbon
atoms are in the molecule and select the corresponding chain base name.
//
--

=== Naming Rings

Chains of three atoms or more can form a cycle of bonds.
//
A cycle of a given length is clearly not the same molecule as the straight chain
of the same length, so our naming strategy needs to differentiate them.
//
This is done by adding "cyclo" before the chain base name.
//
The linear three-carbon chain molecule is "propane," so the
three-carbon cyclic molecule is "cyclopropane."

This is cyclopentane, which has five carbons arranged in a ring:

image::Cyclopentane.png[role='img-fluid']

[.alert.alert-success]
--
//
To pass `testNamingSimpleCyclic`, you need to determine whether the molecule is
cyclic and prepend "cyclo," if appropriate, to the name derived from the carbon
count.
//
--

At this point you will probably need to refine your recursive approach.
//
If you recurse down every possible bond every time, you might end up going
around and around infinitely, in which case your program will crash.
//
You'll need to keep track of which atoms you've seen already using a data
structure and stop once you arrive at them again.

=== Naming Simple Substituents

Useful molecules are usually more complex than just a chain or ring of carbons.
//
Most organic molecules have other atoms or groups attached to the carbon
backbone.
//
For example, this is propane with a bromine bonded to the central carbon:

image::2BromoPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

Things that are hanging off of the backbone are called _substituents_.
//
To fully describe a molecule, we need to indicate not only how many carbons it
has, but also which substituents it has.

Substituent names usually go before the chain base name.
//
The name for a bromine substituent is "bromo."
//
So we might name the previous molecule "bromopropane," but then what would we
name this molecule?

image::1BromoPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

That's also propane with a bromine attached, but in a different place!
//
We need a way to say where the substituent is attached to the backbone.
//
To do this, we number the carbons:

image::NumberedPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

We can then name a bromine substituent on carbon 2 "2-bromo" and a bromine
substituent on carbon 1 "1-bromo."
//
Putting the name fragments together, we name the former molecule
"2-bromopropane" and the latter "1-bromopropane."
//
What about this one?

image::3BromoPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

Numbering carbons from left to right, we would call this 3-bromopropane.
//
But you can rotate the molecule in 3D space and find that it's actually the same
//
as 1-bromopropane.
//
IUPAC rules **prefer the name with the lowest position**, so "1-bromopropane" is
correct and "3-bromopropane" is not.

This is actually easier to deal with on a ring, since we can always number the
ring carbons such that one substituent gets position 1.
//
So this is 1-bromocyclopentane
//
footnote:[Or just bromocyclopentane, since IUPAC and the test suite allow
dropping the "1" from the name when there's only one substituent on the ring.
//
Always including the position is easier to implement, but you may do either.]:

image::BromoCyclopentane.png[role='img-fluid']

As is this:

image::RotatedBromoCyclopentane.png[role='img-fluid']

Substituent names for other halogens are similar.
//
Fluorine is "fluoro," chlorine is "chloro."

It's possible for the carbon chain to branch, and when that happens we get
carbon (_alkyl_) substituents.
//
These are named similarly to straight chains, but suffixed with "yl" instead of
"ane."
//
A single-carbon ("meth") branch is called a "methyl" substituent, so this is
2-methylpropane:

image::Isobutane.png[role='img-fluid']

Since the base name for a two-carbon chain is "eth," one might name this "2-ethylpropane"
because it has a three-carbon backbone with a two-carbon branch:

image::Confusing2MethylButane.png[role='img-fluid']

But if we rotate things a bit, it becomes a four-carbon backbone with a one-carbon branch
(2-methylbutane):

image::2MethylButane.png[role='img-fluid']

IUPAC rules **prefer the longer backbone**, so "2-methylbutane" is correct.
//
"2-ethylpropane" is incorrect (because it has a shorter backbone), as is
"3-methylbutane" (because it has a higher substituent position).

Again, this is actually easier on rings, since we're always going to consider
the cycle the backbone.
//
This molecule has a cycle of three carbons ("cyclopropane") with a three-carbon
branch substituent ("propyl"), so we name it "1-propylcyclopropane":

image::PropylCyclopropane.png[role='img-fluid']

[.alert.alert-success]
//
--
//
To pass `testNamingOneSubstituentCyclic`, you need to find any ring present,
find and name the substituent if present, and assign it position 1 on the ring.

To pass `testNamingOneSubstituentLinear`, you need to find the longest carbon
chain, name the substituent if present, and number the backbone in the direction
that gives the substituent the lowest possible position number.
//
--

Here is a strategy to find the correct backbone and direction:

. Identify all the tip carbons, which are bonded to at most one other carbon
atom
//
. For each tip carbon, recursively find all paths through the molecule starting
at that carbon
//
** Your recursive function will probably take the last carbon visited, the path
taken so far, and the list in which to store complete paths.
//
** At every carbon, recurse into all the attached carbons that aren't the one
previously visited, extending the path taken so far
//
** If another tip has been reached, add the now-finished path to the list of
complete paths
//
. Select the longest carbon chain from the list of complete paths&mdash;this is
the backbone
//
. Find the substituent, if present
//
. If the substituent's position is closer to the high-numbered end of the chain
than to the beginning, reverse the list of backbone carbons

Any carbon atom not in the list of backbone carbons is part of an alkyl
substituent.
//
When exploring alkyl substituent chains to find their length, you must be
careful to avoid recursing back into the backbone.

=== High-Priority Substituents

All the substituents discussed above are named before the backbone in the final,
overall name.
//
They are considered _low-priority_ substituents.
//
There are also high-priority substituents whose presence affects the suffix of
the overall name.
//
These include _alcohols_, _ketones_, _aldehydes_, and _carboxylic acids_.

An alcohol substituent is an OH (oxygen and hydrogen) group attached to the
backbone by a single bond, like in this molecule
//
footnote:[with which most of you should have no experience]:
//

----
  H H
  | |
H-C-C-O-H
  | |
  H H
----

This is the skeletal drawing of the same molecule:

image::Ethanol.png[role='img-fluid']

It has two carbons, so the backbone name is "eth."
//
The substituent can be at position 1 if we number from right to left.
//
Alcohol substituents change the suffix of the name from "ane" to "anol," with
the substituent position inserted before the "ol."
//
So we would name that molecule ethan-1-ol
//
footnote:[Or just ethanol, since it's unambiguous&mdash;ethan-2-ol is the same
molecule.].

Likewise, this molecule has a five-carbon backbone ("pent")
and an alcohol substituent at position 2, so we name it pentan-2-ol:

image::Pentan2ol.png[role='img-fluid']

Ketone substituents are oxygen atoms double-bonded to the backbone.
//
They change the suffix to "anone," again with the position before the "one."
//
This molecule removes fingernail polish:

image::Acetone.png[role='img-fluid']

It has a three-carbon backbone ("prop") and a ketone substituent at position 2,
so its systematic name is propan-2-one.

Alcohols and ketones can both appear on rings too.
//
This is cyclobutan-1-ol (cyclic four-carbon backbone with an alcohol
substituent):

image::Cyclobutanol.png[role='img-fluid']

And this is cyclooctan-1-one (cyclic eight-carbon backbone with a ketone substituent):

image::Cyclooctanone.png[role='img-fluid']

The other two kinds of high-priority substituents we consider can only appear at
the tip of a linear molecule.
//
We'll refer to them collectively as _end groups_.
//
Since they can only occur on tips, they are always assigned position 1, so that
does not need to be made explicit in the name.
//
Aldehydes are essentially ketones that happen to be at a tip
//
footnote:[ They're named differently because they have somewhat different
chemical reactivity.  Collectively, they're referred to as _carbonyls_.].
//
They are named similarly to alcohols, but with "al" instead of "ol" on the end.
//
This molecule has a two-carbon backbone ("eth") and an aldehyde tip ("al"), so
we name it ethanal:

image::Ethanal.png[role='img-fluid']

To identify aldehydes, notice that the tip carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen
and single-bonded to at least one hydrogen.

Carboxylic acids are essentially a combination of an aldehyde and an alcohol on
one tip carbon.
//
They replace the "ane" suffix with "anoic acid."
//
So the three-carbon carboxylic acid is named "propanoic acid":

image::PropanoicAcid.png[role='img-fluid']

To identify carboxylic acids, notice that the tip carbon is double-bonded
to one oxygen and single-bonded to another.

[.alert.alert-success]
//
--
//
To pass `testNamingOneSuffixSubstituent`, you need to find the backbone (whether
linear or cyclic), identify the substituent if present, determine the correct
numbering direction of the backbone if necessary, select the correct base name
and suffix, and include the substituent position if necessary.
//
Note that this is an extension of the naming tasks you have already completed.
//

**You now know all the naming rules you need to get 100 points on MP5.**
//
But you can earn a total of _10 points of extra credit_ by handling more
interesting cases!
//
**Note that these points _do not come easy_.**
//
But if you are up for the challenge read on to learn more.

=== Multiple Substituents

[.alert.alert-primary]
--
**Challenge problem!** You can earn _5 points_ of extra credit for handling this case.
--

A lot of useful molecules have multiple substituents, not just one.
To fully describe these, we need to include information about each substituent in the name.
To do that, we name each substituent by itself, then put all the name fragments together.
Consider this three-carbon molecule:

image::DihalogenatedPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

To minimize the position number of the first substituent encountered,
we number from left to right.
We then have a bromine at position 1 ("1-bromo") and a chlorine at position 2 ("2-chloro").
The carbon backbone's name is "propane," so we put it all together,
separate substituent fragments with an extra dash, and get 1-bromo-2-chloropropane.
Note the lack of dash between the last substituent fragment and the backbone name.

Now let's swap the halogens:

image::SwappedDihalogenatedPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

The molecule is still numbered from left to right, so one might name it 1-chloro-2-bromopropane.
But the correct name is 2-bromo-1-chloropropane&mdash;IUPAC rules
**order substituents alphabetically by name, not numerically by position**.

Now let's make both the halogens chlorine:

image::DichloroPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

When there are multiple substituents with the same name (but not necessarily position),
we combine them into one name fragment by putting all the positions into one sorted comma-separated
list and adding a multiplicity prefix indicating the number of copies of the substituent.
Since this molecule has chlorine at positions 1 and 2, the position list is "1,2";
since there are two instances of the chlorine substituent, we prefix the "chloro" with "di."
(Three is "tri" and so on; the starter code contains an array with all the multiplicity names.)
The full name for this molecule is 1,2-dichloropropane.

It's possible to have multiple substituents at the same position:

image::FluoroMethylPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

That's 2-fluoro-2-methylpropane because the (top) fluorine substituent
and the (bottom) methyl substituent are both on position 2 of the (horizontal) backbone.
Notice that the "fluoro" part is first because F sorts before M.

If the same substituent occurs multiple times on the same carbon,
the position number appears multiple times in the list.
So this is 1,1-difluoropropane:

image::DifluoroPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

The multiplicity prefixes **do not affect the sorting of the substituent names**.
Consider this molecule:

image::ChloroDibromoPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

It has bromine ("bromo") substituents at position 1 and 2, plus a chlorine ("chloro")
substituent at position 1.
So the bromine part of the name is "1,2-dibromo" and the chlorine part is "1-chloro."
The prefix "di" in "dibromo" doesn't count for substituent sorting,
so B sorts before C and the full name is 1,2-dibromo-1-chloropropane.

There can also be multiple high-priority substituents.
Just like with low-priority ones, all the positions at which the substituent occurs
go into the comma-separated list and the multiplicity prefix is added to the substituent name.
Consider this four-carbon chain with two alcohols:

image::ButaneDiol.png[role='img-fluid']

Alcohol substituents occur at positions 2 and 3, and there are two of them,
so the name will end in "-2,3-diol." Since the fragment after the last dash begins with
a consonant, however, the "e" in "ane" is retained (to make the name easier to pronounce).
So the name is butan**e**-2,3-diol, not butan-2,3-diol.

The prefixes for high multiplicities, like "tetra" for four, tend to end with "a."
When the last fragment starts with "o," the multiplicity's "a" is cut off to make the name easier
to pronounce. So this is propane-1,1,3,3-tetrol, not propane-1,1,3,3-tetr**a**ol:

image::PropaneTetrol.png[role='img-fluid']

To pass `testNamingMultipleSubstituents`, you need to find the best backbone
(whether linear or cyclic), number it in a way that minimizes the position of the
first substituent encountered, record the name and position__s__ of all substituents present,
and combine the name fragments together.
This test case does not involve end groups.
The molecules you're asked to name here have _either_ low-priority or high-priority substituents,
not a mix of both.

Up to this point, it's been fairly easy to choose the correct numbering direction
once the backbone is established&mdash;either the molecule was symmetric or
one direction encounters a substituent before the other.
All substituents in each tested molecule had the same priority.
Now it's time for the idea of priority to actually make a difference.
How do we number this molecule?

image::MixedPriorityButane.png[role='img-fluid']

If we go from left to right, the bromine gets position 1 and the ketone gets position 3.
That sounds good.
But the ketone is a high-priority substituent, so its position is more important to minimize.
The correct numbering direction is from right to left, so the name is 4-bromobutan-2-one
("but" from the four-carbon backbone, "2-one" from the ketone at position 2, and "4-bromo"
from the bromine at position 4).

Likewise, if there are any high-priority substituents on a ring,
one should occupy position 1:

image::MethylCyclobutanone.png[role='img-fluid']

That molecule is named 3-methylcyclobutan-1-one because numbering starts at the rightmost carbon.

High-priority substituents also affect the selection of the backbone in non-cyclic molecules.
Previously this molecule would be expected to have a five-carbon backbone:

image::ForkedDiol.png[role='img-fluid']

But (our simplified version of) IUPAC rules say that
**all high-priority substituents must be attached to the backbone**.
So that molecule's backbone is the three carbons between the alcohol substituents,
and the three-carbon chain going off to the left is a "propyl" substituent.
This molecule's name is 2-propylpropane-1,3-diol.

To break ties between possible backbones of the same length after ensuring that
all high-priority substituents are included, compare the total number of substituents:

image::SubCountTiebreak.png[role='img-fluid']

The four-way branch carbon and the three carbons to its left are definitely
included in the backbone because the alcohol is attached over there.
If the backbone continued to the right, the methyl and the fork below would each be substituents.
But if the backbone continued down, the methyl above, ethyl to the right, and methyl
off the three-way branch are each a substituent.
That way produces more substituents and is the correct backbone.
It is numbered from left to right because that direction encounters an alcohol at position 2,
while the other way only encounters a methyl at position 2.

image::NumberedSubCountTiebreak.png[role='img-fluid']

Above is the correctly numbered backbone. The full name is 4-ethyl-4,5-dimethylhexan-2-ol.

Notice how the previous example used position 2 as the direction tiebreak because both
directions had no substituents on backbone carbon 1.
Comparisons continue until the tie is broken.
Consider this nearly symmetric molecule:

image::BromoButaneTriol.png[role='img-fluid']

Either direction has a high-priority substituent at position 1.
Right-to-left has a high-priority substituent at position 2, but left-to-right has
only a low-priority substituent there. So right-to-left wins,
and the correct name is 3-bromobutane-1,2,4-triol.

The presence of multiple substituents on the same carbon can also serve as a tiebreak:

image::TrifluoroPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

Numbering left to right produces one fluorine at position 1, while going
right to left produces two at position 1. So right-to-left wins, and the correct name is
1,1,3-trifluoropropane.
One high-priority substituent beats any number of low-priority ones,
so if the leftmost fluorine was replaced with an alcohol, the numbering would go left to right.

If the count of substituents of both priorities is the same at every backbone carbon,
the final tiebreak is the name of the substituent&mdash;alphabetically first wins:

image::AlphabetTiebreak.png[role='img-fluid']

Both directions have a high-priority substituent at positions 1 and 5
and low-priority substituents at positions 2, 3, and 4.
The substituents are exactly the same at position 1, so tiebreak proceeds to position 2.
Left-to-right has "chloro" where right-to-left has "fluoro."
"Chloro" is first alphabetically, so left-to-right wins: the name is
1,5-dibromo-2-chloro-4-fluoro-3-methylpentane-1,5-diol.

All these rules are the same for cyclic molecules.
This molecule should be numbered starting at the rightmost carbon and going clockwise:

image::BromoCyclobutaneDiol.png[role='img-fluid']

That way, it has high-priority substituents at positions 1 and 2,
plus a low-priority one at position 3.
Starting at the bromine would put a low-priority substituent at position 1 instead.
Starting anywhere else would visit the top (substituent-less) carbon before
getting to all the substituted ones.

On rings, the alphabetic tiebreak affects the starting point in addition to the numbering:

image::TrihalogenatedCyclopropane.png[role='img-fluid']

All six possible numberings have one low-priority substituent at each of the three positions;
the best one puts the alphabetically first substituent in position 1
and the alphabetically next one in position 2.
The correct numbering starts at the bromine and goes counterclockwise,
naming the molecule 1-bromo-2-chloro-3-fluorocyclopropane.

In summary, our rules break backbone and direction ties in this order:

. Has all high-priority substituents directly attached
. Longest carbon chain
. Highest number of total substituents
. Highest number of high-priority substituents at each position (from 1 until tiebreak)
. Highest number of any substituents at each position (from 1 until tiebreak)
. Alphabetically by substituent name
  (from 1 until tiebreak, remember that each position can have multiple substituents!)

A good strategy is to generate a list of candidate backbones/numberings
and filter that down by comparing two at a time.

**You now know all the naming rules you need to get 110 points on MP5!**
None of the molecules we ask you to name have multiple different types of
high-priority substituents, since that requires new rules.
