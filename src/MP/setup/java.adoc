This guide will help you install the software that you need to develop Java
applications.

[[java]]
== Java

[.lead]

https://www.java.com/en/[Java].
//
is a powerful and versatile programming language.
//
You can build all kinds of things with it, from web servers to command line
utilities to Android apps.

If you have a laptop or desktop that you plan to use for CS 125, you should
install Java on it.
//
Follow the instructions below that are appropriate for your machine.
//
But keep in mind that installing new software can be challenging, so don't be
discouraged if you get stuck.

We're here to help!

[[version]]
=== Version

For Fall 2018 we are using Java 10.0.2, the latest available as of available as
of August 2018.
//
Java 9 and 10 have some
//

//
that we may discuss in class compared with Java 8 which you might be more
familiar with if you have used Java before.
//
Please install this version of Java and continue using it throughout the
semester.
//
Minor upgrades will probably not be a problem, and we do not anticipate another
major release of Java before the end of the semester.

=== Install on Linux

If you are installing on Ubuntu Linux you may have more luck by using a packaged
Java installer.

You may need to set an environment variable to ensure that Gradle can find the
correct version of Java.
//
Try this if your local autograder refuses to run.
//
https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html[Here
are some instructions for Windows], and
//
https://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-set-java_home-environment-variable-on-mac-os-x/[here
is a tutorial for Mac].
//
The screencast above shows how to complete the process on Windows machines.
//
*Note that the screencast shows how to do this for Java 9*, so you will need to
set the path correctly to point to the Java 10 version that you installed above.
