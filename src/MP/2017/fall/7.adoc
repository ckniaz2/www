//
You've learned a lot this semester.
//
Now it's time to try out your newly-acquired super powers.
//
MP7 is not about us giving you something to do&mdash;it's about you
accomplishing something _you want_ to do using computer programming.

MP7 is different than previous MPs.
//
It is done in pairs with a partner from your lab section.
//
And it due in your lab section during the last week of class: so during lab on
either Tuesday, December 12th, or Wednesday, December 13th.

[[objectives]]
== Learning Objectives

If the previous MPs have had you execute carefully-planned routes from point A
to point B, MP7 takes you on a journey off the map.
//
You'll learn how to plan and execute a small project of your own design.
//
You'll also learn how to work with a partner.
//
We'll also continue to reinforce the learning objectives from previous MPs
(link:/MP/2017/fall/1/[1], link:/MP/2017/fall/2/[2], link:/MP/2017/fall/3/[3], link:/MP/2017/fall/4/[4], link:/MP/2017/fall/5/[5],
and link:/MP/2017/fall/6/[6]).
//
MP7 brings everything together and starts you out on a career as an independent
software developer.

[[rules]]
== Rules

Our goal in MP7 is to give you as much flexibility as possible, so there are few
rules about what you can and can't do.
//
But those that we do have are important:

* You _must_ do something new for MP7.
//
Do not plan on submitting something from another class, or something you've done
previously.
//
You may want to work on something that you've started on previously, but given
that you'll be working with a partner that's not fair to them.
//
So you should pick something new to do for MP7.
//
It doesn't have to be a huge project&mdash;you only have two weeks.
//
But it should be original work.
//
* You _do not_ have to use Java.
//
You probably will, but you don't have to.
//
* You _can_ use a previous MP as a starting point.
//
Perhaps you'd like to add some image transforms to link:/MP/2017/fall/4/[MP4], or features
to the game from link:/MP/2017/fall/5/[MP5], or additional functionality to
link:/MP/2017/fall/6/[MP6].
//
That's fine!
//
You don't have to, but these previous projects can provide a good starting
point.
//
* You _have to_ work with a partner from your lab section.
//
You turn in MP7 by presenting it in lab during the last week of class, and you
and your partner should plan that together.
//
* You _do_ have to publish your work on GitHub&mdash;privately if you want.
//
So you should set up your project using Git and be able to show that you have
committed and pushed your code to GitHub as part of your turn-in presentation.

[[help]]
== Getting Help

While MP7 is self-driven, please feel free to approach the course staff for
help.
//
Post on the {forum}, or come to office hours and discuss your project idea and
implementation with the doyens.

[[grading]]
== Grading

Grading for MP7 will be generous.
//
It is worth 100 points total, broken down as follows:

. *25 points* for doing something original
//
. *25 points* for ensuring that both partners have roles in the project
//
. *25 points* for presenting your work during your final lab section
//
. *25 points* for properly publishing your work on GitHub

There is (obviously) no autograding or online testing for MP7.
//
Grading will be entirely at the discretion of the course staff.

[[submitting]]
== Submitting Your Work

You and your partner should prepare a 5 minute presentation for the last lab
section during the final week of class.
//
Your presentation should cover what you did, why you did it, who did what, and
any other interesting details: interesting technical problems you encountered,
how you collaborated, or ideas for future work.
//
You should also confirm that this was an original project and that it was
published to GitHub under one or both of the project partner's accounts.

[[cheating]]
=== Academic Integrity

Please review the link:/MP/2017/fall/1/[MP1 academic integrity guidelines].
//
In addition, for MP7 any attempt to turn in non-original work will be treated as
an academic integrity violation.
//
Consider yourself warned.
