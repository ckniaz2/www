[.lead]
//
As we have learned previously, computers are frequently used to transform and
analyze data.
//
And an increasing amount of that data is _multi-dimensional_: including both
photo and video data.
//
People are taking a
//
https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/how-many-photographs-of-you-are-out-there-in-the-world/413389/[huge
amount of photos and video],
//
and processing that data is almost entirely done on or by computers.

For MP4 you'll be working with two-dimensional photo pixel data as you complete
the server part of a simple photo editing application.
//
*It is due Friday, October 20th, 2017 @ 5PM. To receive full credit, you must
submit by this deadline.*
//
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP4 is for committing code that earns at least
_50 points_ by *Friday, October 13th, 2017 @ 5PM.*

[[objectives]]
== Learning Objectives

The purpose of MP4 is to continue introducing you to data transformation.
//
You'll begin to learn how to:

. implement various image transformations by performing transformations on 2D
arrays
//
. avoid writing repetitive code by identifying similarities between various
transformations
//
. working with bits and bytes to get and set pixel color channel information

We'll also continue to reinforce the learning objectives from previous MPs
(link:/MP/2017/fall/1/[1], link:/MP/2017/fall/2/[2], and link:/MP/2017/fall/3/[3]).

[[structure]]
== Assignment Structure

MP4 consists of a simple client-server system.
//
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the client are provided for you.
//
But it relies on your backend to work properly.

Your job is to complete the required transformations in `Transform.java`.
//
These functions are called by the web server that is set up using `WebServer.java`.

As always, you may find our official
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Fall-2017-MP4/[MP4 online documentation]
//
helpful in understanding what each function is supposed to do.

[[getting]]
=== Obtaining MP4

Please follow the instructions from link:/MP/2017/fall/1/#getting[MP1].
//
You'll find MP4 in an `MP4` folder in your Subversion home directory.
//
Unless you want to learn a lot more about Subversion, *do not delete your MP4
folder once you have it.*

[[requirements]]
=== Your Goal

At this point you should be familiar with the requirements from previous MPs.
//
MP4 is similar, and retains (but strengthens) the starting the assignment on
time grading component from link:/MP/2017/fall/3/[MP3].
//
See the <<grading, grading description below>>.

[[running]]
=== Running MP4

To experiment with the web interface, do the following:

. Run `WebServer.java` as a Java application. You may need to correct errors with
`Transform.java` before this will work.
//
. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8125[`http://localhost:8125`].

At first, nothing will work because you have not implemented any of the required
transformations yet.
//
Note that our web interface uses some new-ish browser features, and of course
Internet Explorer hasn't implemented all of them yet.
//
We have confirmed that
//
https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html[Chrome],
//
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/[Firefox],
//
and
//
https://www.apple.com/safari/[Safari]
//
work on both Mac and Windows footnote:[Well, not Safari on Windows, for obvious
reasons].

A common problem with using Eclipse to complete MP4 are so-called _port
collisions_.
//
This will happen if you try to start a new web server running your latest
completed transformations without shutting down the one that is currently
running.

Here's how to do this properly.
//
This problem is also covered by the video above.

. Stop your program using the Eclipse red stop button.
//
. Restart your server with your latest changes.

If you encounter the problem described above, here is how to fix it:

. Stop the failed web server using the stop button.
//
. Close that console using the Eclipse close cross icon.
//
. This should show you the console that is running the old web server that is
causing the problem. Shut that down using the stop button, and then you can
restart the web server with your changes.

[[approach]]
== Approaching MP4

All of our previous advice about how to approach the CS 125 MPs still applies.
//
But MP4 has some unique features that are designed to continue your development
as computer scientists and software developers.

[[dry]]
=== Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

[.lead]
//
Whenever you write software, you should try to adhere to the DRY principle:
_don't repeat yourself_.

What does this mean?
//
It means that you should try to avoid writing duplicative code&mdash;multiple
functions (or parts of the same function) that perform identical tasks.

Consider the fact that any computer program _could_ be written as one giant
function and with no subroutines at all
//
footnote:[Don't try this at home.].
//
But the result would be awful, since any time the program needed to repeat a
task it would have to repeat the code needed to accomplish that task.
//
And any time you fixed a bug in one part of the code, you'd have to find every
other identical part and fix the bug there as well.
//
Code like this quickly becomes impossible to understand, test, debug, and
improve&mdash;and will also make it hard to keep a job.

At first glance, MP4 may seem daunting.
//
You have _22_ functions to write!
//
And yes, you can complete MP4 by writing 22 separate independent functions.

But there is a much smarter way to approach MP4.
//
As a hint, the solution set consists of only _six_ real functions&mdash;with the
rest just calling into this much smaller set of _helper functions_.
//
The reason is that many of the transformations perform similar operations.
//
For example, a shift down is similar to a shift up, as well as a shift left and
a shift right.
//
So rather than writing four separate extremely-similar functions, I can write a
slightly more complicate generic shift function and have it called by all of the
others.

There is a balance here that requires practice to get right.
//
Trying to reduce the needs of 22 different functions to one single method
produces overly-complicate and brittle code.
//
But writing them all separately misses opportunities to harness common
subroutines.
//
You'll get better at this with practice, and MP4 is a good chance to get some.
//
So *do not* implement 22 separate transformation functions, but also *do not*
attempt to implement one function that does everything.
//
There are some natural groupings that you will probably be able to identify.

[[pixels]]
=== Manipulating Binary Data

MP4 requires you to manipulate binary pixel data stored in Java `int` primitive
types.
//
The `int` values in the 2D array passed to your functions contain 4 bytes in
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA_color_space[RGBA]
//
order:

. The first (lowest) byte in the `int` stores the _red_ value, which goes from 0
(no red)&ndash;255 (maximum red).
//
. The second byte in the `int` stores the _green_ value, which goes from 0 (no
green)&ndash;255 (maximum green).
//
. The third byte in the `int` stores the _blue_ value, which goes from 0 (no
blue)&ndash;255 (maximum blue).
//
. The fourth (highest) byte in the `int` stores the _alpha_ value, which goes
from 0&ndash;255.
//
The alpha channel sets the _transparency_ of the pixel, which affects how it
blends with pixels below it in the image.
//
A value of 0 makes the pixel fully transparent, while a value of 255 makes it
fully opaque (completely non transparent).

One way to remember this is to say that a RGBA hex value stores the values as
`0xAABBGGRR`.

Several of your transformation functions will need to manipulate the color data
in individual image pixels.
//
So we suggest that you set up some _helper functions_ to manipulate color and
alpha channel values.

[[coordinates]]
=== Understand Your Coordinate System

If you are used to working with the coordinate plane in mathematics, the canvas
coordinate system can take some getting used to.
//
In particular:

. `(0, 0)` is at the _top left_, not the bottom left.
//
. Increasing Y values move the image _down_, not up&mdash;keep this in mind when
implementing `shiftUp` and `shiftDown`.
//
. Increasing X values move the image to the right, which matches the
mathematical coordinate system.

==== Centering

Understanding the coordinate system is also important when centering the image
around `(0, 0)`, which you need to do to implement the rotate, flip, and resize
transformations.
//
This is probably one of the trickier parts of MP4, so think it through
carefully.

It is helpful to work some simple examples.
//
For example, consider vertically flipping a 2x2 array.
//
In our coordinate system, the coordinate values of the pixels in the array would
be:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `(0, 0)` | `(1, 0)`

| `(0, 1)` | `(1, 1)`

|===

*Note that these are the coordinate values, not the pixel contents*.
//
In order to flip the array properly, we need to adjust the coordinate values as
follows:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `(-0.5, -0.5)` | `(0.5, -0.5)`

| `(-0.5, 0.5)` | `(0.5, 0.5)`

|===

At this point I can swap either the X or Y values and achieve either a
horizontal or vertical flip around the origin.
//
There is only one problem&mdash;Java can't use `double` types as array indices.
//
So we need to do this transformation on a pixel-by-pixel basis.
//
Roughly, here is the approach.
//
For each pixel in the original image:

. Center the pixel
//
. Determine how to transform it to a new location in the transformed image
//
. Undo the centering transformation
//
. Move data from the original image to the transformed image

Once you have a centering procedure that works, you can use it for the
rotations, flips, expands, and shrinks.
//
But this is one of the tougher parts of the assignment, so you might want to
start with the parts that don't require centering: position shifts, color
shifts, green screen and the mystery function.

==== Shrinking and expanding

As a final note about coordinates, please consider carefully how to implement
the shrink and expand transformations.
//
Specifically, if I start with this 2x6 array (with pixel values shown):

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `0` | `0` | `1` | `1` | `0` | `0`

| `0` | `0` | `1` | `1` | `0` | `0`

|===

and expand it horizontally by a factor of 3, this is the correct result:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1`

| `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1`

|===

But it is easy to get this instead:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `1` | *`0`* | `1` | `1` | *`0`* | `1`

| `1` | *`0`* | `1` | `1` | *`0`* | `1`

|===

You will want to think about this carefully.
//
As a hint, instead of starting with the original array and trying to figure out
where each pixel _goes_ in the transformed array, you may want to start with the
transformed array and calculate where each pixel should _come from_.
//
Also keep in mind that simply casting a double to an integer _does not round the
value properly_.
//
So `(int) doubleValue != Math.round(doubleValue)`.

The video above is optional, but may interest those that are curious about how a
modern web application works.
//
It walks through most of what happens from the moment you click one of the image
transformation buttons, to when transformed data returns from the server.

[[grading]]
== Grading

MP4 is worth 100 points total, broken down as follows:

. *80 points*: `Transform.java`
  ** *10 points* for submitting code that compiles
  ** *10 points* for completing the position shift transformations
  ** *20 points* for completing the rotation and flip transformations
  ** *20 points* for completing the color shift transformations
  ** *10 points* for completing the shrink and expand transformations
  ** *5 points* for completing the green screen transformation
  ** *5 points* for completing a mystery transformation
. *10 points* for no `checkstyle` violations
. *10 points* for committing code that earns at least 50 points before *Friday,
October 13th, 2017 @ 5PM.*

[[testing]]
=== Test Cases

As in previous MPs, we have provided exhaustive test cases
for each part of MP4.
//
Please review the link:/MP/2017/fall/1/#testing[MP1 testing instructions].

[[autograding]]
=== Autograding

Like previous assignments, we provide you with an autograding script that you
can use to estimate your current grade as often as you want.
//
Note that, like link:/MP/2017/fall/3/[MP3], the local autograder can only calculate 90 out
of your 100 total points.

Unless you have modified the test cases or autograder configuration files, the
autograding output should equal the score that you will earn when you submit.
//
*If you modify our test cases or the autograding configuration, all bets are
off.*

[[submitting]]
== Submitting Your Work

Overall you should refer to link:/MP/2017/fall/setup/subversion[our instructions for using
Subversion].
//
Commit early and often!
//
You only earn credit for the version of your code that is committed to your
repository, so ensure that we have your best submission before the deadline.

And remember, you must commit something that earns 50 points before *Friday,
October 13th, 2017 @ 5PM* to earn 10 points on the assignment.
//
This is a bit of a higher bar than in previous assignments, since fixing basic
compiler and checkstyle errors will only get you 20 points.
//
So you'll need to complete a few of the image transformation functions to get
past this bar.

[[cheating]]
=== Academic Integrity

Please review the link:/MP/2017/fall/1/[MP1 academic integrity guidelines].
