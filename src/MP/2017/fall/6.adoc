//
Recursion is an important and powerful programming technique.
//
Sometimes it is the best way to solve a problem, and sometimes it is almost _the
only_ way to solve a problem.
//
Recursion can be tricky to wrap your head around at first, but as usual the best
way to get comfortable with this technique is to practice.

For MP6 you'll complete several programming tasks that encourage you to develop
recursive solutions.
//
*It is due Friday, November 17th, 2017 @ 5PM. To receive full credit, you must
submit by this deadline.*
//
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP6 is for committing code that earns at least
_50 points_ by *Monday, November 13th, 2017 @ 5PM.*

[[objectives]]
== Learning Objectives

MP6 introduces the concept of recursive programming.
//
You'll learn how to complete simple recursive methods to accomplish common
programming tasks.
//
We'll also introduce you to binary trees, an important computer science data
structure and one very amenable to recursive approaches.

We'll also continue to reinforce the learning objectives from previous MPs
(link:/MP/2017/fall/1/[1], link:/MP/2017/fall/2/[2], link:/MP/2017/fall/3/[3], link:/MP/2017/fall/4/[4], and
link:/MP/2017/fall/5/[5]).
//
In particular, MP6 requires you to continue practicing object-oriented design,
both through subclassing and the use of generic types.

[[structure]]
== Assignment Structure

MP6 consists of three programming tasks:

* `ReverseList.java`: here you must extend a generic parent class and provide a
reversal method, either using recursion or iteratively.
//
Consider this task a warm up.
//
List reversal is straightforward, and the hardest part of this task is probably
getting the generic subclassing right.
//
* `Tree.java`: here you must complete a binary tree class, including adding
constructors and insertion methods, along with methods that search and perform
computations on your tree.
//
This tasks contains the bulk of the points for the MP, so work on it once you've
finished `ReverseList.java`.
//
* `DNA.java`: for the final task you must complete a class that stores a DNA
sequence and a static method that computes the longest common subsequence of two
DNA instances.
//
Longest common subsequence is the hardest algorithmic challenge on this MP, so
leave this for the end.

Like link:/MP/2017/fall/5/[MP5], MP6 provides a bit less scaffolding than previous MPs.
//
The official specification is our
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Fall-2017-MP6/[MP6 online documentation].
//
It should precisely define what each public method in each class should do.
//
Private methods are left for you to design in any way that allows the tests to
pass.
//
If you believe that the documentation is unclear, please post on
the {forum} and we'll offer a clarification is needed.

[[getting]]
=== Obtaining MP6

Please follow the instructions from link:/MP/2017/fall/1/#getting[MP1].
//
You'll find MP6 in an `MP6` folder in your Subversion home directory.
//
Unless you want to learn a lot more about Subversion, *do not delete your MP6
folder on the server.*
//
This is something that you cannot fix on your own using the Eclipse Subversive
Subversion plugin, and will need to get course staff help with.

[[approach]]
== Approaching MP6

Completing MP6 requires writing fewer lines of code than link:/MP/2017/fall/4[MP4] and
link:/MP/2017/fall/5/[MP5].
//
But it is _recursive_ code, so it will take you longer.
//
Don't expect to make as much progress writing recursive code when you are
getting started.
//
It's tricky, and takes practice.
//
Slow down and focus on applying the recursive design principles that we've
taught in lecture and in lab.

=== Understand The Requirements

To complete MP6 you _must_ understand the
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Fall-2017-MP6/[specification].
//
Read that first.
//
And then read it again.

=== Designing Recursive Functions

Recall the guidelines for designing recursive functions that we presented in
//
Lab 10:

. *Every recursive function must have a base case.*
//
If you don't stop recursing, you will eventually run out of memory and
your program will crash.
//
So there must be some case where you do not call yourself again.
//
. *The base case must be reached.*
//
As a corollary to the above, every set of recursive calls must eventually
_reach_ the base case, otherwise (again) your program will recurse infinitely,
run out of memory and crash.
//
. *The problem should get smaller each time.*
//
Each recursive step should reduce the size of the problem somehow.
//
This can happen in several ways.
//
In Fibonacci, for example, we reduce the size of the problem by reduction toward
known staring values.
//
When processing trees, we reduce the size of the problem by splitting the tree
into several subtrees which are considered separately.
//
How this happens depends on the problem, but it does need to happen somehow.

It can also be helpful to consider simple cases.
//
How do you reverse a list with only one element?
//
Now, extend that to a list with two elements, then three.
//
You may begin to see a pattern emerge that helps you understand how to design
your recursive approach.

[[trees]]
=== Binary Trees

[.lead]
//
MP6 also introduces you to
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree[_binary trees_],
//
an important computer science data structure.
//
Binary trees are also recursive data structures, in that each tree node refers
to other tree nodes, including a parent (moving up the tree) and two children
(down the tree).

Like other data structures, binary trees are useful because of the algorithms
that we can run on them.
//
Sorting and searching can be particularly efficient on binary trees due to the
way that they structure data.

[[insertion]]
==== Insertion algorithm

There are many great online resources to help you learn about binary trees.
//
But let's consider one of the more basic tree operations: insertion.
//
Storing data in my tree requires that I be able to insert values.
//
And being able to efficiently search for values later requires that I perform
insertions in a particular way.

. Start at the root of the tree.
//
. Compare the value that is being inserted with the value of the current node.
//
. If it is larger, try to move to the right.
//
. If it is smaller, try to move to the left.
//
. If the current node has a left or right child (depending on the choice above),
make that the current node and continue.
//
. Otherwise set the left or right child (depending on the choice above) of the
current node to a new node with the new inserted value.
//
. Continue until the node is inserted.

Note that your binary trees can reject duplicate values.
//
So if you reach a node that has the _same_ value as the one you are trying to
insert, the insertion can fail.

If you maintain the sorted structure during your insertions as described above,
the other algorithms that we ask you to complete on trees will be
straightforward.

=== Getting Help

The course staff is ready and willing to help you every step of the way!
//
Please come to link:/info/2017/fall/syllabus/#calendar[office hours], or post (in the
right place) on the {forum} when you need help.
//
You should also feel free to help each other, as long as you do not violate the
<<cheating, academic integrity requirements>>.

[[grading]]
== Grading

MP6 is worth 100 points total, broken down as follows:

. *10 points*: `ReverseList.java`
. *50 points*: `Tree.java`:
  ** *10 points* for constructors and insertion
  ** *10 points* for minimum and maximum
  ** *10 points* for search
  ** *10 points* for depth counting
  ** *10 points* for descendant counting
. *20 points*: `DNA.java`
. *10 points* for no `checkstyle` violations
. *10 points* for committing code that earns at least 50 points before
Monday, November 13th, 2017 @ 5PM.

[[testing]]
=== Test Cases

As in previous MPs, we have provided exhaustive test cases
for each part of MP6.
//
Please review the link:/MP/2017/fall/1/#testing[MP1 testing instructions].

[[autograding]]
=== Autograding

Like previous assignments, we provide you with an autograding script that you
can use to estimate your current grade as often as you want.
//
Note that, like previous MPs, the local autograder can only calculate 90 out of
your 100 total points.

Unless you have modified the test cases or autograder configuration files, the
autograding output should equal the score that you will earn when you submit.
//
*If you modify our test cases or the autograding configuration, all bets are
off.*

[[submitting]]
== Submitting Your Work

Overall you should refer to link:/MP/2017/fall/setup/subversion[our instructions for using
Subversion].
//
Commit early and often!
//
You only earn credit for the version of your code that is committed to your
repository, so ensure that we have your best submission before the deadline.

And remember, you must commit something that earns 50 points before *Monday,
November 13th, 2017 @ 5PM* to earn 10 points on the assignment.
//
This is a bit of a higher bar than in previous assignments, since fixing
checkstyle errors will only get you 10 points and there are no points for just
compiling.
//
So you'll need to complete a few bits of class logic past this bar.

[[cheating]]
=== Academic Integrity

Please review the link:/MP/2017/fall/1/[MP1 academic integrity guidelines].
