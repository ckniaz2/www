//
Functions are an important part of how we structure computer programs.
//
Breaking your code into well-documented functions makes it easier to understand,
easier to test and debug, and easier for others to use.

MP2 comprises four small functions that exercise your growing programming
abilities in several different ways.
//
You'll get practice working with strings and arrays, and a gentle introduction
to two-dimensional arrays.

*MP2 is due Monday 9/24/2018 @ 5PM.
//
To receive full credit, you must submit by this deadline.*
//
Note that the deadline is right before the first CS 125 midterm, but we expect
that MP2 will help you prepare for the midterm exam.
//
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP2 is for submitting code that earns at least
_20 points_ by *Friday 9/21/2018 @ 7PM.*
//
Note that, unlike link:/MP/1/[MP1], you have to do a bit more work on MP2 to get
to 20 points.

As usual, late submissions will be subject to the
//
link:/info/syllabus/#regrading[MP late submission policy].

[[objectives]]
== Learning Objectives

MP2 aims to provide practice with defining, documenting, and implementing
functions&mdash;the basic building blocks of computer programs.
//
You'll begin to learn how to:

. declare and implement functions
//
. write Javadoc comments for your new functions
//
. read Javadoc documentation to determine how to implement a function, and
//
. use simple two-dimensional arrays.

We'll also continue to reinforce the learning objectives from link:/MP/0/[MP0]
and link:/MP/1/[MP1].

[[structure]]
== Assignment Structure

MP2 consists of four short programs:

. https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP2-Starter/Anagram.html[`Anagram.java`]:
//
determines if two strings are anagrams.
//
You will need to complete this function.
//
. https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP2-Starter/CheckPassword.html[`CheckPassword.java`]:
//
checks if a password meets certain requirements.
//
You will need to declare and complete this function.
//
. https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP2-Starter/StringSplitter.html[`StringSplitter.java`]:
//
splits a string whenever the character changes.
//
You will need to declare, complete, and document this function.
//
. https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP2-Starter/TimesTable.html[`TimesTable.java`]:
//
produces a times table given two numbers.
//
**This file doesn't even exist yet!**
//
You'll have to create it, and then declare, complete, and document
`generateTimesTable`.
//
You'll also need to add a `main` method if you want to test it without using
test suite.

You will need to use our official
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP2-Starter/package-summary.html[MP2 online documentation]
//
to understand what the functions are called and what they are supposed to do,
since we have not always provided documentation&mdash;or even a file to start
with at all!

[[getting]]
=== Obtaining MP2
Use
//
https://classroom.github.com/a/823c5Z02[this GitHub Classroom invitation link]
//
to fork your copy of MP2.
//
Once your repository has been created, import it into IntelliJ following
//
link:/MP/setup/git/#workflow[our assignment Git workflow guide].

[[requirements]]
=== Your Goal

At this point you should be familiar with the requirements from
link:/MP/0/#requirements[MP0] and link:/MP/1/#requirements[MP1].
//
MP2 is similar.
//
However, unlike link:/MP/0/[MP0] and link:/MP/1/[MP1] you no longer get free
points for your code compiling.
//
In the real world it doesn't matter if your code compiles&mdash;it has to work!

[[approach]]
== Fixing Problems

All of the link:/MP/0/#approach[MP0] and link:/MP/1/#approach[MP1] about how to
approach the MPs still apply.
//
But as usual, we'll furnish your continued development as programmers with some
additional advice&mdash;this time about _fixing problems_.

We've all been there.
//
My stupid code is not working!
//
Why not?
//
I'm angry, I'm frustrated, I want to throw my computer through a window or stomp
it to bits.
//
*What should you do?*

=== Calm Down

Well, the first thing to do is _calm down_.
//
This can be a good time to get a cup of coffee, take a walk, engage in some
//
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dsGWM5XGdg[YouTube browsing],
//
catch up on email, or whatever
//
footnote:[I don't recommend smoking, however, since it's unhealthy and habit
forming. I found out the hard way.]
//
Get your head out of what you are doing for a few minutes and you'll be fresher
when you get back.

=== Accept Responsibility

Second, accept that something is _wrong with your code_.
//
If it's not doing what you want, then that's obvious.
//
And for CS 125, the test suites are the arbiters of correctness.
//
So if you aren't passing them, then your code is incorrect.
//
Period.

=== Do A Slow, Close Read

Now that you're calmer and ready to find your mistakes, go through your code
carefully line by line.
//
This can be a good time to do some cleanup&mdash;add comments where needed,
improve your variable names, get all of your indentation and formatting worked
out, etc.
//
Sometimes looking at your code in a slightly different way causes a bug to
become apparent.
//
And you might as well be doing other useful tasks as you do your close read.

During your first slow read it can be helpful to actually read code out loud, or
at least in your head so that you don't bother others around you.
//
For example, if you're examining the code below:

++++
<script
src="https://gist.github.com/gchallen/b6ff23b1c26659f920e8a71026816c42.js"></script>
++++

You might say:

[.spelling_exception]
//
. "For every index value of searchArray" (you want to develop a shorthand for
loops)
//
. "If the index member of anotherArray is equal to what I'm search for"
//
. "Then break."
//
. "But wait, why am I using an index from searchArray to look in anotherArray?
That's probably wrong."

This is a place where it _really_ helps to use variable names that aren't `i`
and `j`, and to pull the current value of arrays into a local variable
immediately or use the
//
https://blogs.oracle.com/corejavatechtips/using-enhanced-for-loops-with-your-classes[enhanced `for` loop syntax].

=== Add Instrumentation

Once you've completed one pass, start over and begin adding some
`System.out.println` statements.
//
This is sometimes called `printf` _debugging_, after the
//
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_printf.htm[C
language `printf` statement]&mdash;it's
//
equivalent to `System.out.println` in Java.
//
In Java, of course, you would use `System.out.println` to do this.

You will find that there are snobs out there that look down on `printf`
debugging.
//
Hook up a real debugger, they'll say.
//
Or rewrite your entire project using a functional programming language where
bugs are impossible&mdash;as if that's a real possibility.

And then there are the rest of use that just want to build cool and useful
things as quickly as possible, and who will _happily_ take the chance to add
instrumentation as needed.
//
`printf` debugging is not powerful enough to solve every problem, and there are
times that you will need better tools.
//
But use it when you can.
//
And remind the snobs what none other than
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan[Brian Kernighan] says:

[quote, 'https://stackoverflow.com/a/238686[Brian Kernighan]']
____
The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with
judiciously placed print statements.
____

Usually the right approach is to start at the top of the block of code that you
are examining and use `System.out.println` to examine things that you are unsure
are working properly.
//
This is particularly useful when used in conjunction with test suites.

=== Consider A Different Approach

If you are really stuck, it might be time to try a different approach.
//
This is particularly true when you can acknowledge that your current approach
has some, shall we say, limitations.
//
Maybe you thought that this particular way of doing things would work out well,
but then you had to add one hacky bit, and another.
//
And now it's rapidly approaching spaghetti code that you're not even sure that
you understand anymore.

In that case, by all means start over!
//
You're learning, and you'll learn more by completing a few alternative
implementations than you will by clinging to an ugly solution.
//
Feel free to talk to another student&mdash;<<cheating, _In
English_>>&mdash;about how they approached the problem.
//
Maybe they found a much cleaner way that you can try.

=== Getting Help

The course staff is ready and willing to help you every step of the way!
//
Please come to link:/info/syllabus/#calendar[office hours], or post on the
{forum} when you need help.
//
You should also feel free to help each other, as long as you do not violate the
<<cheating, academic integrity requirements>>.

[[grading]]
== Grading

MP2 is worth 100 points total, broken down as follows:

. *20 points*: `Anagram.java`
  ** *20 points* for passing the test
//
. *20 points*: `CheckPassword.java`
  ** *20 points* for passing the test
//
. *20 points*: `SplitString.java`
  ** *20 points* for passing the test
//
. *20 points*: `TimesTable.java`
  ** *20 points* for passing the test
//
. *10 points* for no `checkstyle` violations
//
. *10 points* for submitting code that earns at least 20 points before
*Friday 9/21/2018 @ 7PM.*

Note that, unlike link:/MP/1/[MP1], you do need to do a bit of work to get to 20
points, since there are no free points for just getting things to compile.

[[testing]]
=== Test Cases

Like link:/MP/0/[MP0] and link:/MP/1/[MP1], we have provided exhaustive test cases
for each part of MP2.
//
Please review the link:/MP/0#testing[MP0 testing instructions].

[[autograding]]
=== Autograding

Like link:/MP/0[MP0] and link:/MP/1/[MP1], we have provided you with an
autograding script that you can use to estimate your current grade as often as
you want.
//
Please review the link:/MP/0#autograding[MP0 autograding instructions].

[[submitting]]
== Submitting Your Work

Follow the instructions from the
//
link:/MP/setup/git#submitting[submitting portion]
//
of the
//
link:/MP/setup/git#workflow[CS 125 workflow]
//
instructions.

And remember, you must submit something that earns 20 points before *Friday
9/21/2018 @ 7PM* to earn 10 points on the assignment.

[[cheating]]
=== Academic Integrity

Please review the link:/MP/0#cheating[MP0 academic integrity guidelines].

Here's how you'll feel if we catch you cheating in CS 125:
