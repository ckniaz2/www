[.lead]
//
As we have learned previously, computers are frequently used to transform and
analyze data.
//
And an increasing amount of that data is _multi-dimensional_: including both
photo and video data.
//
People are taking a
//
https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/how-many-photographs-of-you-are-out-there-in-the-world/413389/[huge
amount of photos and video],
//
and processing that data is almost entirely done on or by computers.
//
For MP4 you'll be working with two-dimensional photo pixel data as you complete
the server part of a simple photo editing application.

*MP4 is due Friday 3/9/2018 @ 5PM.
//
To receive full credit, you must submit by this deadline.*
//
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP4 is for submitting code that earns at least
_50 points_ by *Monday 3/5/2018 @ 5PM.*

As usual, late submissions will be subject to the
//
link:/info/syllabus/#regrading[MP late submission policy].

[[objectives]]
== Learning Objectives

The purpose of MP4 is to continue introducing you to data transformation.
//
You'll begin to learn how to:

. implement various image transformations by performing transformations on 2D
arrays
//
. avoid writing repetitive code by identifying similarities between various
transformations
//
. work with existing object classes

We'll also continue to reinforce the learning objectives from previous MPs
(link:/MP/2018/spring/0/[0], link:/MP/2018/spring/1/[1], link:/MP/2018/spring/2/[2], and link:/MP/2018/spring/3/[3]).

[[structure]]
== Assignment Structure

Like link:/MP/2018/spring/3/[MP3], MP4 consists of a simple client-server system.
//
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the client are provided for you.
//
But it relies on your backend to work properly.

Your job is to complete the required transformations in `Transform.java`.
//
These make use of a pixel class defined in `RGBAPixel.java`.
//
These functions are called by the web server that is set up using `WebServer.java`.

As always, you may find our official
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring-2018-MP4-Starter/[MP4 online documentation]
//
helpful in understanding what each function and class is supposed to do.

[[getting]]
=== Obtaining MP4
Use
https://classroom.github.com/a/cjTkpLN6[this GitHub Classroom invitation link]
//
to fork your copy of MP4.
//
Once your repository has been created, import it into IntelliJ following
//
link:/MP/setup/git/#workflow[our assignment Git workflow guide].

[[requirements]]
=== Your Goal

At this point you should be familiar with the requirements from previous MPs.
//
See the <<grading, grading description below>>.

[[running]]
=== Running MP4

To run MP4, follow the instructions from
//
link:/MP/2018/spring/3#running[MP3].

At first, nothing will work because you have not implemented any of the required
transformations yet.
//
Our web interface also uses some new-ish browser features, and of course Internet
Explorer hasn't implemented all of them yet.
//
We have confirmed that
//
https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html[Chrome],
//
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/[Firefox],
//
and
//
https://www.apple.com/safari/[Safari]
//
work on both Mac and Windows footnote:[Well, not Safari on Windows, for obvious
reasons].

[[approach]]
== Approaching MP4

All of our previous advice about how to approach the CS 125 MPs still applies.
//
But MP4 has some unique features that are designed to continue your development
as computer scientists and software developers.

[[dry]]
=== Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

[.lead]
//
Whenever you write software, you should try to adhere to the DRY principle:
_don't repeat yourself_.

What does this mean?
//
It means that you should try to avoid writing duplicative code&mdash;multiple
functions (or parts of the same function) that perform identical tasks.

Consider the fact that any computer program _could_ be written as one giant
function and with no subroutines at all
//
footnote:[Don't try this at home.].
//
But the result would be awful, since any time the program needed to repeat a
task it would have to repeat the code needed to accomplish that task.
//
And any time you fixed a bug in one part of the code, you'd have to find every
other identical part and fix the bug there as well.
//
Code like this quickly becomes impossible to understand, test, debug, and
improve&mdash;and will also make it hard to keep a job.

At first glance, MP4 may seem daunting.
//
You have _22_ functions to write!
//
And yes, you can complete MP4 by writing 22 separate independent functions.

But there is a much smarter way to approach MP4.
//
As a hint, the solution set consists of only _six_ real functions&mdash;with the
rest just calling into this much smaller set of _helper functions_.
//
The reason is that many of the transformations perform similar operations.
//
For example, a shift down is similar to a shift up, as well as a shift left and
a shift right.
//
So rather than writing four separate extremely-similar functions, I can write a
slightly more complicate generic shift function and have it called by all of the
others.

There is a balance here that requires practice to get right.
//
Trying to reduce the needs of 22 different functions to one single method
produces overly-complicate and brittle code.
//
But writing them all separately misses opportunities to harness common
subroutines.
//
You'll get better at this with practice, and MP4 is a good chance to get some.
//
So *do not* implement 22 separate transformation functions, but also *do not*
attempt to implement one function that does everything.
//
There are some natural groupings that you will probably be able to identify.

[[coordinates]]
=== Understand Your Coordinate System

If you are used to working with the coordinate plane in mathematics, the canvas
coordinate system can take some getting used to.
//
In particular:

. `(0, 0)` is at the _top left_, not the bottom left.
//
. Increasing Y values move the image _down_, not up&mdash;keep this in mind when
implementing `shiftUp` and `shiftDown`.
//
. Increasing X values move the image to the right, which matches the
mathematical coordinate system.

Another important pitfall is that the that way that two-dimensional arrays in
Java are initialized _does not_ match up with this coordinate system.
//
So, for example, this static array:

[source,java]
----
int[][] myArray = {
  { 1, 2 },
  { 3, 4 }
};
----

corresponds to _this_ image array:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `1` | `3`

| `2` | `4`

|===

We suggest that you _do not_ try to interpret the statically initialized arrays in
the test suite directly.
//
Instead, use the output from `RGBAPixel` helper methods, which is correctly
formatted.

==== Centering

Understanding the coordinate system is also important when centering the image
around `(0, 0)`, which you need to do to implement the rotate, flip, and resize
transformations.
//
This is probably one of the trickier parts of MP4, so think it through
carefully.

It is helpful to work some simple examples.
//
For example, consider vertically flipping a 2x2 array.
//
In our coordinate system, the coordinate values of the pixels in the array would
be:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `(0, 0)` | `(1, 0)`

| `(0, 1)` | `(1, 1)`

|===

*Note that these are the coordinate values, not the pixel contents*.
//
In order to flip the array properly, we need to adjust the coordinate values as
follows:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `(-0.5, -0.5)` | `(0.5, -0.5)`

| `(-0.5, 0.5)` | `(0.5, 0.5)`

|===

At this point I can swap either the X or Y values and achieve either a
horizontal or vertical flip around the origin.
//
There is only one problem&mdash;Java can't use `double` types as array indices.
//
So we need to do this transformation on a pixel-by-pixel basis.
//
Roughly, here is the approach.
//
For each pixel in the original image:

. Center the pixel
//
. Determine how to transform it to a new location in the transformed image
//
. Undo the centering transformation
//
. Move data from the original image to the transformed image

Once you have a centering procedure that works, you can use it for the
rotations, flips, expands, and shrinks.
//
But this is one of the tougher parts of the assignment, so you might want to
start with the parts that don't require centering: position shifts, color
shifts, green screen and the mystery function.

==== Shrinking and expanding

As a final note about coordinates, please consider carefully how to implement
the shrink and expand transformations.
//
Specifically, if I start with this 2x6 array (with pixel values shown):

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `0` | `0` | `1` | `1` | `0` | `0`

| `0` | `0` | `1` | `1` | `0` | `0`

|===

and expand it horizontally by a factor of 3, this is the correct result:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1`

| `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1`

|===

But it is easy to get this instead:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `1` | *`0`* | `1` | `1` | *`0`* | `1`

| `1` | *`0`* | `1` | `1` | *`0`* | `1`

|===

You will want to think about this carefully.
//
As a hint, instead of starting with the original array and trying to figure out
where each pixel _goes_ in the transformed array, you may want to start with the
transformed array and calculate where each pixel should _come from_.
//
Also keep in mind that simply casting a double to an integer _does not round the
value properly_.
//
So `(int) doubleValue != Math.round(doubleValue)`.

*Finally, note that shrinking is not tested by the test suite.*
//
You can feel free to implement it to get your web interface to work like the
solution, but it will not affect your score.

==== Testing diff helper

You will notice that the `RGBAPixel` class defines a not very helpful `static`
method to show the difference between two photo arrays.
//
You should feel free to improve this method so that it is more useful during
your debugging.

modern web application works.
//
It walks through most of what happens from the moment you click one of the image
transformation buttons, to when transformed data returns from the server.

[[grading]]
== Grading

MP4 is worth 100 points total, broken down as follows:

. *80 points*: `Transform.java`
  ** *20 points* for completing the position shift transformations
  ** *20 points* for completing the rotation and flip transformations
