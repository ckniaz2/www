https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html[Android Studio]
//
is _the_ integrated development environment (IDE) for Android development.
//
Happily, Android Studio is based on
//

previous MPs.

Follow the instructions below that are appropriate for your machine.
//
But keep in mind that installing new software can be challenging, so don't be
discouraged if you get stuck.

available as of March 2018.

Please install this version of Android Studio and continue using it throughout
the semester.

Minor upgrades are probably safe to install.

If a major upgrade is released, the course staff will let you if it is safe to
use.

An important part of Android development is to be able to test your work.
//
If you have an Android device, you can configure Android Studio to install your
test app onto it.
//
However, if you don't have an Android device, or want to test on devices other
than ones that you own, you'll need to utilize the
//
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html[Android Emulator].

The easiest way to get a virtual device set up is to start a project, build it,
and then try to run it.
//
That will launch a dialog allowing you to configure a virtual device.

Follow the screencast above for a complete description.
