//
We think that you'll have the best success in CS 125 working on your own
personal computer&mdash;preferably a laptop.
//
However, if you need to use the engineering workstations in the basement of
Siebel and other engineering buildings, instructions follow.

== Git and Java

Happily both Git and Java are already installed on the EWS machines.
//
At present Java is still on version 1.8, and it is the
//
http://openjdk.java.net/[open source OpenJDK]
//
rather than the proprietary Oracle JDK.
//
We don't think that this is going to matter, but if you are worried that it
might you can install Oracle Java by following the
//
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html[instructions
on their web site].

== IntelliJ

IntelliJ is available using the

Linux software modules system].
//
The screencast above walks you through the process of activating and using the
module.
//
At that point you can continue with the instructions about

and establishing your
