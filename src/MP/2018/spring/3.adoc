//
Maybe you play them, maybe you don't, maybe you carry your gaming desktop with
you at all times&mdash;but regardless of how you feel about it, a fair number of
people use computers to play games.
//
Some of those games can be instructive, some can be fun.
//
But an MP where you get to build a fun game is both fun _and_ instructive!
//
For MP3 you'll be learning Java class design and object-oriented programming as
you complete a simple Connect-4-like game.

*MP3 is our first two week MP and due Friday 2/23/2018 @ 5PM.
//
To receive full credit, you must submit by this deadline.*
//
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP3 is for submitting code that earns at least
_40 points_ by *Friday 2/16/2018 @ 5PM.*
//
Note that, unlike link:/MP/2018/spring/2[MP2], you have to do a bit more work on MP3 to get
to 40 points&mdash;but the early deadline is also later to accommodate that.

As usual, late submissions will be subject to the
//
link:/info/2018/spring/syllabus/#regrading[MP late submission policy].

[[objectives]]
== Learning Objectives

The purpose of MP3 is to begin introducing you to object-oriented programming.
//
MP3 does not explore more advanced topics like inheritance, interfaces, or
polymorphism.
//
It sticks to the basics: instance and class variables, getters and setters,
constructors, and instance and class methods.
//
You'll begin to learn how to:

. design a class that meets a given specification
//
. implement that class including both properly-protected variables and
appropriate methods

We'll also continue to reinforce the learning objectives from link:/MP/2018/spring/0/[MP0],
link:/MP/2018/spring/1/[MP1], and link:/MP/2018/spring/2/[MP2].

[[structure]]
== Assignment Structure

MP3 consists of a simple client-server system.
//
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the client are provided for you.
//
But it relies on your backend to work properly.

Your job is to create and complete `ConnectN.java`.
//
These functions are called by the web server that is set up using `WebServer.java`.

MP3 provides a bit less scaffolding than previous MPs.
//
This is intentional.
//
Eventually you'll need to write code from scratch, and frequently you'll need to
follow a specification written by other developers or a project manager.

For MP3, the official specification is our
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring-2018-MP3-Starter/ConnectN.html[MP3 online documentation].
//
It should precisely define what each public method in `ConnectN.java` should do.
//
If you believe that the documentation is unclear, please post on
the {forum} and we'll offer a clarification is needed.

[[getting]]
=== Obtaining MP3
Use
https://classroom.github.com/a/dDWeWpgw[this GitHub Classroom invitation link]
//
to fork your copy of MP3.
//
Once your repository has been created, import it into IntelliJ following
//
link:/MP/2018/spring/setup/git/#workflow[our assignment Git workflow guide].

[[requirements]]
=== Your Goal

At this point you should be familiar with the requirements from previous MPs.
//
See the <<grading, grading description below>>.

To experiment with the web interface, do the following:

. Run `WebServer.java` as a Java application.
//
You'll need to at least create `ConnectN.java` and get a few things working
before the web server will run at all.
//
. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8126[`http://localhost:8126`].

At first, nothing will work because you have not implemented any of the required
game transformation functions yet.

As far as browser support, we have confirmed that
//
https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html[Chrome]
//
works.
//
Other browsers may or may not&mdash;but Chrome definitely does.

[[approach]]
== Approaching MP3

While the concepts are new, MP3 is not a lot of code to write, and you have two
weeks.
//
But here are the bits that are likely to trip you up.

=== Read the Fine Manual

To complete MP3 you _must_ understand the
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring-2018-MP3-Starter/[specification].
//
That's your starting point, and your returning point when you get confused.

Writing code to a specification is an important skill to learn.
//
In many software companies, designing code and implementing it are not always
done by the same group.
//
A project manager or program manager may write a specification, which is
provided to developers to implement.
//
Or a team of developers may come up with a specification, and then divide up the
implementation work between them.

Regardless of where it comes from, writing code in groups almost always requires
a specification to be successful&mdash;unlike when you do independent projects
and can make up things as you go.
//
A lot of the design work and high-level decisions end up going in to the
specification, so by the time the implementation begins the hard and interesting
choices have been made.
//
That's not to say it still isn't fun at that point&mdash;even developing to a
spec provides huge opportunities for simultaneous creativity and correctness in
that unique programming way.

=== Getters and Setters

MP3 requires you to implement some simple getters and setters (just return or
change the variable), and some ones with more complicated behavior.
//
Be sure to read the documentation carefully.

=== Game Logic

You will need to do a bit of work to implement the game board.
//
ConnectN is a Connect-4-like game.
//
Tiles fall in the top (large Y values) and sit at the bottom.
//
Just to confuse you a bit, we've reversed the coordinates from last week.
//
So we're now in the proper first quadrant of 2D space, with X values going left
to right and Y values going down to up:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `(0, 2)` | `(1, 2)` | `(2, 2)`

| `(0, 1)` | `(1, 1)` | `(2, 1)`

| `(0, 0)` | `(1, 0)` | `(2, 0)`

|===

A ConnectN game ends when either player plays N consecutive tiles in either a
single row or column footnote:[There: I said row and column.].
//
Tiles always have to be played at the lowest possible location in each
column&mdash;in a real Connect-4 board they fall downward and rest on the tiles
below them.
//
Consult the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four[Wikipedia] page for more
details.

=== Class Variables and Methods

Classes can define methods and variables that are not attached to instances.
//
See `Player.java` for an example of a class variable used to provide each
instance with a unique ID.
//
You'll need to implement some of these for `ConnectN.java`.

=== Equality

Be careful about varying definitions of equality.
//
You'll need to implement `ConnectN.equals`, but its definition of equality is
quite strict.
//
On the other hand, the class comparison methods use a different definition of
equality.
//
Passing all of the tests requires distinguishing between the two and
implementing each correctly.

=== Getting Help

The course staff is ready and willing to help you every step of the way!
//
Please come to link:/info/2018/spring/syllabus/#calendar[office hours], or post on the
{forum} when you need help.
//
You should also feel free to help each other, as long as you do not violate the
<<cheating, academic integrity requirements>>.

[[grading]]
== Grading

MP3 is worth 100 points total, broken down as follows:

. *80 points*: `ConnectN.java`
  ** *5 points* for completing the title modifications
  ** *15 points total* for completing the width, height, and N value getters and
  setters
  ** *10 points* for completing the constructors
  ** *15 points* for completing the get and set board functions
  ** *10 points* for determining the game winner properly
  ** *10 points* for calculating equality correctly
  ** *10 points* for class static methods, including equality checks and factory
  creation methods
  ** *5 points* for maintaining the game count and ID properly
. *10 points* for no `checkstyle` violations
. *10 points* for submitting code that earns at least 40 points before *Friday
2/16/2018 @ 5PM.*

[[testing]]
=== Test Cases

As in previous MPs, we have provided exhaustive test cases
for each part of MP3.
//

[[autograding]]
=== Autograding

Like link:/MP/2018/spring/0[MP0] and link:/MP/2018/spring/1/[MP1], we have provided you with an
autograding script that you can use to estimate your current grade as often as
you want.
//
Please review the link:/MP/2018/spring/0#autograding[MP0 autograding instructions].

[[submitting]]

//
of the
//
link:/MP/2018/spring/setup/git#workflow[CS 125 workflow]
//
instructions.

And remember, you must submit something that earns 40 points before *Friday
2/16/2018 @ 5PM* to earn 10 points on the assignment.
